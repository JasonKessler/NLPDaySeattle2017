## Understanding Cultures and Perspectives through Text and Emoji Visualization
## Jason S. Kessler (CDK Global)

This talk is about visualizing how language differes across groups and categories.  

Two Python libraries I've developed, Scattertext and AgeFromName, are heavily used in the talk.

Please install them and if you have time, star them on Github:

- [Scattertext](https://github.com/JasonKessler/scattertext)
- [AgeFromName](https://github.com/JasonKessler/agefromname)

`$ pip install scattertext agefromname && python -m spacy.en.download`

It's news you can use: six Python 3.6 Jupyter notebooks showing how to visualize the following data:

- [Introduction to Scattertext](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/JasonKessler/NLPDaySeattle2017/blob/master/Scattertext-Intro-Part-1.ipynb)
- [Analyzing President Trump's Twitter stream before and after the election](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/JasonKessler/NLPDaySeattle2017/blob/master/President-Trump-Twitter-Analysis-Part-2.ipynb)
