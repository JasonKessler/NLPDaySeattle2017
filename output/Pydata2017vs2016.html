Unevenly spaced time series analysis of The Simpsons in Pandas\n \nIndeed data scientists occasionally analyze time series data in which the events of interest are unevenly spaced. For example, when we want to understand how a change to a user interface for Indeed Hire recruiters affects the time it takes them to review candidates, we might look at changes in time intervals between individual candidate dispositions in our logs. When we want to understand the ratio of new business to repeat business - or explore different definitions of repeat business - we analyze the intervals in the creation dates of new requisitions from the same client.\nThe Pandas data analysis library offers powerful tools for conducting time series analysis. When working on unevenly spaced time series, we have found the shift() and transform() DataFrame methods particularly helpful. Many of the examples of using these methods that we found on the web were used only on small, artificial datasets. Determining how best to apply them to real datasets was not always as straightforward as we would have hoped.\nRather than use internal proprietary data to illustrate examples of how these methods can be used effectively to analyze unevenly spaced time series data, we will instead use data from a publicly available dataset of episodes of The Simpsons at data.world. In doing so, we will also provide an introduction on how to use the data.world API.\nThe purpose of this tutorial is to\n\nProvide a brief, focused primer on some basic aspects of Pandas\nProvide an overview of data.world datasets and accessing them via the API\nShow how advanced Pandas tools can be used for analyzing unevenly spaced time series data\n\nParticipants will be best prepared for this tutorial if they\n\nUnderstand Python basics\nHave Python 2 or Python 3 installed on their computers\nInstall  the latest versions of Pandas and Jupyter Notebook (recommended: use Anaconda)\nInstall the data.world Python API (pip install git+git://github.com/datadotworld/data.world-py.git)\nCreate a data.world account and an API key via the data.world Advanced Settings page\n\nUpdate: jupyter notebooks associated with the tutorial have been uploaded to a GitHub repository.\n \nThis tutorial will explore the use of tools in the Pandas data analysis library for analyzing unevenly spaced time series data. The tutorial will start off with a brief primer on Pandas and the data.world API, and demonstrate how to use Pandas tools for analyzing data from The Simpsons episodes from data.world.", "From Novice to Data Ninja\n \nData are all around us and come in all sizes and shapes. As a beginner Python learner you often dream to become a master of all data types and handle them with ease: but soon you get intimidated by piles of libraries and unfamiliar jargon surrounding specific data formats and processing tools. The good news is that once you overcome the initial hurdles, you realize that you can analyze these diverse datasets using similar methodology.   \nThe goal of this tutorial is to provide participants with hands-on experience working with diverse types of data: text, sound, video, graphs, GIS. Each data module will include an example with a small dataset to introduce the properties of the data type, and one with a larger dataset to equip the learners with tools to handle the vast data in the wild. Throughout the tutorial we will illustrate how same data mining techniques can be used on different types of data.\nhttps://github.com/valentina-s/Novice2DataNinja\n \nThis tutorial aims to introduce beginner Python learners to the diverse types of data a\u00a0data scientist may face at work: time series, images, videos, text, graphs, geospatial data.

Participants will also learn tips and tricks how to handle large datasets of each kind.", "So you want to be a Python expert?\n \n.\n \n.", "Introduction to data analytics with pandas\n \nIntroduction\nIn this hands-on workshop, we'll walk through the exploratory analysis of real-world data. Datasets are often messy, full of holes and inconsistencies, and a data scientist or analyst may spend a large fraction of their time cleaning and preparing data.\nFortunately, pandas makes a lot of this fairly trivial. It allows the user to import data from all sorts of different sources, and then manipulate the powerful DataFrame object. Analytics with pandas are human-friendly.\nWorkshop\nPulling in the data\nStarting with some data in CSV form, we'll look at the general properties of our dataset. What columns do we have; what kind of values are contained in them ? We'll identify problematic fields, and join two datasets to make one complete dataframe.\nCleaning\nWe've identified problems with our data, and now it's time to correct them. We'll fill in missing values, drop irrelevant rows, and fix incorrect datatypes. \nTransforming the data\nNext, we'll standardise some numerical fields where we're looking for deviations rather than absolute values, and derive some new columns based on the data we have.\nVisualisation\nThroughout, we'll be generating visualisations, to guide us in where to go next. \nPrerequisites\nYou'll need to be fairly comfortable working with Python. We won't be doing anything overly complicated, but having a grasp of Python syntax is expected.\nLaptop\nIf you want to follow along, please have a working Python setup, with pandas and matplotlib installed. Aim for a recent version of pandas. If you're unsure what to install, I recommend getting Python 3 through Anaconda : https://www.continuum.io/downloads - this distribution comes with everything you need and is very friendly.\n \nData analytics in Python benefits from the beautiful API offered by the pandas library. With it, manipulating and analysing data is fast and seamless. In this workshop, we'll take a hands-on approach to performing an exploratory analysis in pandas. We'll begin by importing some real data. Then, we'll clean it, transform it, and analyse it, finishing with some visualisations.", "Parallelizing Scientific Python with Dask\n \nDask is a flexible tool for parallelizing Python code on a single machine or across a cluster. \nWe can think of dask at a high and a low level\n\n\nHigh level collections: Dask provides high-level Array, Bag, and DataFrame collections that mimic and build upon NumPy arrays, Python lists, and Pandas DataFrames, but that can operate in parallel on datasets that do not fit into main memory. \n\n\nLow Level schedulers: Dask provides dynamic task schedulers that execute task graphs in parallel. These execution engines power the high-level collections mentioned above but can also power custom, user-defined workloads to expose latent parallelism in procedural code. These schedulers are low-latency and run computations with a small memory footprint. \n\n\nDifferent users operate at different levels but it is useful to understand both.

I will highlight several models it supports, specifically probability distributions, mixture models, naive Bayes, Markov chains, hidden Markov models, and Bayesian networks. At each step I will show that these models are both faster and more flexible than other implementations in the open source community along with code examples. In addition, I will show how to utilize the underlying modularity of the code to stack these models to produce more complicated ones such as mixtures of Bayesian networks, or HMMs with complicated mixture emissions.

This includes evaluating the available fields, by finding unique counts or by calculating summary statistics such as averages for numerical fields. These summaries help in understanding what is in the data itself, the underlying quality, and illuminate potential paths for further exploration. In structured data, this a straightforward task, but for unstructured text, different types of summaries are needed. Some useful examples for text data include a count of the number of documents in which a term occurs, and the number of times a term occurs in a document. Since vocabulary terms often have variant forms, e.g. \u201cperforms\u201d and \u201cperforming\u201d, it is useful to pre-process and combine these forms before computing distributions. Oftentimes, we want to look at sequences of words, for example we may want to count the number of times \u201cdata science\u201d occurs, and not just \u201cdata\u201d and \u201cscience\u201d.

Good practices for reproducible science are to publish used codes under Open Source licenses, perform code reviews, save the computational environments with containers (e.g., Docker), use open data formats, use a data management system, and record the provenance of all actions. \nThe provenance of data provides detailed information about the origin of that data. That includes information about ownership and both actions and modifications performed on the data. With provenance information, data will be traceable and users can be confident in quality of the data. To specify and store provenance information, W3C has standardized the provenance model PROV. Using PROV and associated implementations, users can record provenance of data analytics processes.

I can write a program to look at an image of an animal and tell you whether it\u2019s a cat or dog, for example. The measure of my program\u2019s quality is its performance on new inputs: how many images does it classify correctly without ever having seen them before? How I accomplish that\u2014what exactly it is about the images that allows me to distinguish a cat from a dog\u2014is almost irrelevant compared to how well my program does on the task.\nBut what if I don\u2019t just want my system to be good at recognizing that you\u2019re showing it a picture of a cat, I also want to be able to give you clear instructions on the top n things you can do to turn that cat into a dog? Now all of a sudden I have to start thinking differently about the information that my model uses to do the classification. I need features that are still automatable (I can tell a computer how to measure them and use them as inputs to a machine learning algorithm) but are also explainable (a lay person can understand what they mean and how to change their values). I may also find issues in my training/test data that I might not have noticed if I hadn\u2019t had to do the same amount of introspection. \nIn this talk, I\u2019ll walk through a toy machine learning problem end-to-end, showing how our approach has to change when we add the requirement of producing actionable guidance.

Using a topic modeling approach and cosign similarity we attempt to recommend patents similar to the text of a potential new patent. This would allow inventors and engineers to quickly reference patents similar to their own and easily cite them. \nFrom an architectural stand point we use big query to handle data ingestion and pre-processing. The data management functionality of big query is key because there are millions of patents some of which may contain hundreds of pages of text. After pre processing in big query the bulk of our analytic work is done in spark through the python wrapper which allows for easy parallelization of the analytical portion.\n \nCan citations write themselves? Using a topic modeling approach we model similarity between patents from the US patent database via cosine similarity.

It has named columns, each of which can contain a different data type, and an index to identify rows and assist in joining. The scikit-learn package is the major machine learning library in python. It has implementations for a wide variety of popular feature engineering, supervised, and unsupervised machine learning algorithms. Perhaps even more importantly to its success, scikit-learn provides a uniform interface for these transformers and estimators, making it easy to swap out one for another.\nMany scikit-learn transformers will take and return pandas DataFrames, but some only return numpy arrays. This means losing the column names and row indices. A few important examples include the meta-transformers Pipeline and FeatureUnion. The Pipeline chains together transformers to be applied in order. The FeatureUnion combines the results of transformers that can be applied in parallel. With these, the entire feature engineering process can be stored in one object and easily applied to new data sets.\nLuckily, scikit-learn also provides the ability to write your own custom transformers. It is as simple as defining a new class that implements the fit and transform methods. We can use this to create pandas-friendly versions of the Pipeline and FeatureUnion, as well as add transformations that are not already provided.\n \nUsing pandas and scikit-learn together can be a bit clunky. For complex preprocessing, the scikit-learn Pipeline conveniently chains together transformers. But, it will convert your DataFrame to a numpy array. In this talk, we will walk through pandas DataFrames, scikit-learn preprocessing and Pipelines, and how to use custom transformers to stay in pandas land.\nGitHub Link: https://github.com/jem1031/pandas-pipelines-custom-transformers", "Scan Statistics with Spark Streaming: Distribution Based Real Time Anomaly Detection\n \nScan Statistics is a distribution based methodology for detecting anomalous data.

Rather than focusing on the concepts you want the system to learn and how those can be taught, you often find yourself dealing with low-level details like network topology and hyperparameters. \nDatabases solved this problem for data by allowing users to program at a higher level of abstraction. Databases eschew low-level implementation details and instead build a model of the information (the schema) using a high-level declarative programming language (such as SQL). The database server actualizes this model and manages its usage with real data. Similarly, for artificial intelligence, one can build a model for conceptual understanding (the mental model) using a high-level declarative programming language (such as Inkling). A runtime server can then be used to actualize this model and manage its usage with real data.\nKeen Browne explains how Bonsai\u2019s platform enables every developer to add intelligence to their software or hardware, regardless of AI expertise.

These frameworks can also be used as teaching tools for those who are getting started in neural networks and deep learning. However, often students and practitioners start from textbooks and research papers in order to learn about these powerful techniques, and get bogged down in mathematical notation and jargon. This talk proposes a different approach through three high-level steps: 1. learning the basics of neural network architectures and applications, 2. experimenting with these models through code examples, and 3. revisiting the math and theory behind these models with a more practical understanding of how they work. We will focus mainly on architectures for three popular types of neural networks (feed-forward, convolutional, and recurrent), setting aside the issue of optimizing these networks during training. \nThis talk assumes some familiarity with supervised machine learning and classification, but assumes no prior knowledge of neural networks or deep learning. A familiarity with Python is beneficial, since this talk presents neural nets primarily from the perspective of programming using a high-level library. However, if you are familiar with another programming language or deep learning library, the concepts will likely make sense. A detailed talk outline is given below:\n1. Overview of Popular Network Architectures and Applications\na. Feed-forward networks\nb. Convolutional networks\nc. Recurrent networks\n\n2. Brief Overview of Keras API\na.

Conclusion and Questions\n \nThis talk will cover learning about neural networks through programming and experimentation. In particular, we will use the Keras library as a straightforward way to quickly implement popular neural network architectures such as feed-forward, convolutional, and recurrent networks.

I wanted to as well, so I embarked on a side project to learn more. This talk is the story of my journey, using, of course, my favorite programming language, Python.\nIn this talk, I will take you through my project, a lighting replay system. The application monitors the light levels in several rooms of a residence and then replays a similar pattern when the house is unoccupied. The goal is to make the house look occupied, with a lighting pattern that is different every day, but looks realistic. It accounts for the different patterns found in each individual room as well as seasonal factors (e.g. changing sunrise/sunset times). The full source code for the application is available on github here.\nAudience\nA basic knowledge of Python is assumed, and exposure to the PyData ecosystem helpful, but no special knowledge about hardware or data science is needed to follow this talk.\nOutline\nThe application was built in three phases: 1) data capture, 2) data analysis, and 3) the lighting player.\nData Capture\nLight sensor data is gathered via ESP8266-based microcontrollers. These chips have only 96 kilobytes of data RAM, but have built-in WiFi and can run MicroPython, a lightweight implementation of Python 3 that works without an operating system. Data is sent to a Raspberry Pi via the MQTT messaging protocol. There, it is saved into CSV files for offline processing.\nData Analysis\nThe light sensor data is next analyzed. The CSV data files are parsed, post-processed, and read into Pandas Series data structures. The raw and processed data can be visualized in a Jupyter notebook.\nThe light readings are then grouped into four levels via K-Means clustering. These four levels are mapped to on-off values, depending on the particulars of each room (e.g. how much ambient light is present). We divide each day into four \"zones\", based on the absolute time of day and sunrise/sunset times. The samples are grouped into subsequences separated by zone and by gaps in the data readings.\nThese subsequences are then used to train Hidden Markov Models using Hmmlearn. Hmmlearn can infer a state machine that will emit a similar pattern of on/off samples. A total of four models are created per room, with one for each zone.\nLighting Player\nThe light controller application runs off the Hidden Markov Models created in the analysis phase. It controls Philips Hue smart lights, which are accessible via a REST api. We use the phue library to abstract the details of the control protocol. Since both the light sensors and the lights are wireless, this application can be easily deployed without replacing light switches or stringing wires through the house.\n \nThis talk will take you through the design of a smart lighting system, including sensor hardware and software (based around MicroPython), data analysis (using NumPy, Pandas, and Jupyter), and lighting control (using Hidden Markov Models via Hmmlearn). From the talk, you should get a sense of how the hardware, software, and math fit together to create a solution.", "Applying the four-step \"Embed, Encode, Attend, Predict\" framework to predict document similarity\n \nA new framework for building Natural Language Processing (NLP) models in the Deep Learning era has been proposed by Matthew Honnibal (creator of the SpaCy NLP toolkit). It is composed of the following four steps - Embed, Encode, Attend and Predict. Embed converts incoming text into dense word vectors that encode its meaning as well as its context; Encode adapts the vector to the target task; Attend forces the network to focus on the most important parts of the data; and Predict produces the network's output representation. Word Embeddings have revolutionized many NLP tasks, and today it is the most effective way of representing text as vectors. Combined with the other three steps, this framework provides a principled way to make predictions starting from unstructured text data. This presentation will demonstrate the use of this four step framework to build Deep Neural Networks that do document classification and predict similarity between sentence and document pairs, using the Keras Deep Learning Library for Python.\n \nThis presentation will demonstrate Matthew Honnibal's four-step \"Embed, Encode, Attend, Predict\" framework to build Deep Neural Networks to do document classification and predict similarity between document and sentence pairs using the Keras Deep Learning Library.", "WorldRowing.com: End To End Data Analysis\n \nEver wonder if 10,000 hours is really the baseline?

The APIs across different processing systems such as Apache Spark or Apache Flink are also different. This forces the end user to learn a potentially new system every time. Apache Beam [1] addresses this problem by providing a unified programming model that can be used for both batch and streaming pipelines. The Beam SDK allows the user to execute these pipelines against different execution engines. Currently Apache Beam provides a Java and Python SDK.\nIn the talk, we start off by providing an overview of Apache Beam using the Python SDK and the problems it tries to address from an end user\u2019s perspective. We cover the core programming constructs in the Beam model such as PCollections, ParDo, GroupByKey, windowing and triggers. We describe how these constructs make it possible for pipelines to be executed in a unified fashion in both batch and streaming. Then we use examples to demonstrate these capabilities. The examples showcase using Beam for stream processing and real time data analysis, and how Beam can be used for feature engineering in some Machine Learning applications using Tensorflow. Finally, we end with Beam's vision of creating runner and execution independent graphs using the Beam FnApi [2].\nApache Beam [1] is a top level Apache project and is completely open source. The code for Beam can be found on Github [3].\n[1] https://beam.apache.org/\n[2] https://s.apache.org/beam-fn-api\n[3] https://github.com/apache/beam\n \nIn this talk, we present the new Python SDK for Apache Beam - a parallel programming model that allows one to implement batch and streaming data processing jobs that can run on a variety of execution engines like Apache Spark and Google Cloud Dataflow.

Bridging .NET and CPython runtimes is the easiest approach to solving this problem. Python for .NET (pythonnet, Python.NET) makes this possible by wrapping CPython C-API from C# in .NET and Mono runtimes. This also allows two-way interoperability between both runtimes on Windows, Linux, and OSX (MacOS), and even Linux subsystem on Windows!  This presentation is going to show how to use Python code from .NET and .NET assemblies from Python.\nParticular importance in Python.NET is given to installation options: Python wheels, conda and nuget binaries, docker images, and even distribution with WinPython. The deployment is also simplified with tools such as PyInstaller and cx_freeze. This presentation will show how to install and deploy Python.NET apps using these tools.\nIn this talk we are going to show how to call numpy, scipy, pandas, matplotlib, sympy, and pyomo from .NET without much boilerplate code.

This talk will also demonstrate clrmagic - Jupyter extension, built on top of pythonnet and developed by authors of this presentation.\nPython.NET is built with a number of open-source technologies. It uses pycparser, ply, and clang (gcc and MSVC also work) for parsing internal CPython structures. .NET types are exposed to Python with Unmanaged Exports (DllExport) open-source \"compiler\" on Windows. On other platforms, C-API of Mono and CPython are used to \"bootstrap\" both runtimes.\nPython.NET is used by financial algorithmic trading platforms, engineering companies, and few open-source projects: QuantConnect Lean, pywebview, Pybee Beeware Toga cross-platform UI toolkit.

To do this, we had to tackle the problem from both product and engineering perspectives.  Along the way, we learned about how notebooks fit into data-science work and how we could best leverage them to provide value to our users.\nWe present major findings from user research that we conducted, including user surveys, a design sprint, and analysis of Civis data scientists' notebooks.  For instance, we learned that in addition to providing an exploratory workspace, notebooks can be used as deliverables in two very different ways: to document a particular analysis, and to build reports or dashboards.  The former requires that running the notebook generate the same results every time.  The latter requires updated results every time.  Our users often get their data by querying a live system, so we built an always-on data store of past queries that can be used when analyses must be reproducible.  We also educated our users about various tools for building reports from notebooks.\nAnother significant engineering challenge is collecting the dependencies for a notebook.  Notebooks are typically used on local machines that accumulate state over time.  This is in contrast to cloud instances, which are dynamically provisioned.  Bundling dependencies with a notebook is a major value-add, as it allows dependencies to be changed and shared easily without affecting other notebooks.  We were able to take advantage of Docker on Kubernetes to manage dependencies and bring provisioning delays down to acceptable levels, though this remains a significant technical challenge.\nFinally, we present ways that notebook products could improve to better integrate with enterprise cloud platforms.  For example, better support for non-local filesystems or UI for observing the status of long-running operations (querying a remote data warehouse, for example) could help move cloud notebooks further into the enterprise.\n \nThe product and engineering teams of Civis Analytics integrated Jupyter notebooks into our cloud-based platform, providing the ability to run multiple notebooks concurrently and share them.  We'll discuss the technical challenges we encountered and how we solved them, and what we learned about notebook users and their user stories.", "Chatbots - Past, Present and Future\n \nIn the past few months, chatbots have made headlines and have become a much-required interface for communication.

One of Python's major strengths is its ability to readily interface with many other languages and harness their strengths.  When it comes to speed, compiled, statically-typed languages are hard to beat.  Because of this, data science libraries often harness compiled shared libraries for their compute-intensive operations.  In a small environment with few of these dependencies, this often works quite well.  However, as the number of binary dependencies grows, the risk of incompatibility increases.\nThe Anaconda distribution and its package manager, Conda, have been very successful as platforms in part because the wide array of packages built for Anaconda by Continuum are built to be binary compatible.  Unfortunately, as more people and more communities build their own Conda packages that are not binary compatible with Anaconda or each other, more users have expressed confusion and consternation when things don't just work in all cases.\nTo address this issue, we have needed to develop tooling at both package build time, to better track and establish the actual limits of binary compatibility, and also at package install time, to allow conda to make better use of this information to inform users of what they can expect to work.  We\u2019ll talk about new features in our build tool, conda-build, that helps us choose our desired binary compatibility.  We\u2019ll also talk about our new automated build system that helps us flesh out a much larger range of compatibility by building more combinations of packages with limited binary compatibility.  Finally, we\u2019ll also talk about the extra data that you\u2019ll soon be able to provide to Conda, so that you will have more power to say exactly what you want.\n \nPython is a wonderful language, capable of gluing just about any number of other languages together, allowing us to reap the strengths of each language.  The cost of this is myriad opportunities for library and binary incompatibility.  This talk will cover some of the common ways that incompatibility arises, as well as several approaches that Continuum uses or is developing to reduce headache.", "Beginning Julia: Language and Landscape\n \nWhy is an alternative to Python needed for numerical work?  Data Science (clustering) and Machine Learning (neural network activation functions) provide two good reasons to look forward to Julia 1.0.  This talk is built on the just released version 0.6.\nCalculation, precision, storage, representation and graphing all need to be considered, especially at scale. Exponential and Matrix operations  are prone to underflow, overflow and and accumulated rounding errors could lead to  dire consequences.

The training data need to fit in memory, but we can make predictions on arbitrarily-large Redshift tables in roughly constant time, given a large enough pool of EC2 instances. The software and execution environment are packaged into Docker containers for reproducibility and speed in setting up on new EC2 instances.\nThe challenges on the training side are in massaging input data to match the formats which scikit-learn models expect and in storing enough metadata to ensure that we can reproduce the arrays of features at prediction time. Predictions distribute chunks of data to their own EC2 instances.

The idea of using constraints to verify input, intermediate and output data for/from analytical processes.\nThe tdda library (available from Github and PyPI) provides tooling support for both of these, major current components being\n  - Support for writing tests, under unittest or pytest, than involve comparison of complex objects (e.g. graphs, dataframes etc.), possibly with variable components, and regenerating reference (\"expected\") results easily when they have changed (after verification!)\n  - Support for automatically generating suggested constraints from example datasets/data frames (including Pandas DataFrames)\n  - Support for verifying a dataset/dataframe against a set of constraints\n - Support for generating regular expressions from example strings, for possible use as constraints (or otherwise).\n(It will probably do more by May, but these things are there now!)\nThis tutorial will introduce users to using these ideas through the tdda library.

Probabilistic programming enables us to build a model on small data and estimate many unknown parameters (optimal number of clusters, cluster probabilities, cluster centres/means and standard deviation...) whilst passing the uncertainty along into the final parameter estimates, so for example, we'll get a range of likely values for a cluster mean, not just a point estimate. \nAs wifi point id is in fact known, we effectively have information about true clusters to test against.

Proper model selection plays a huge part in the performance of a machine learning model. It is remarkable then, that the industry standard algorithm for selecting model parameters, is something as simple as random search.\nRandom search works well when we can sample the validation loss cheaply. However, in some settings it can sometimes take on the order of hours, or maybe even days, to get a single sample from the validation loss. In those cases, it feels very wasteful to not guide our search by previous samples.\nBayesian optimisation uses Gaussian processes to model the loss function. Using the Bayesian paradigm, we can then update our model, when we have computed the validation loss for a new set of parameters. I will talk you through the inner workings of the algorithm, so that we can better understand how it explores the parameter space.\nBut how do we use this algorithm in our day to day work? I'll briefly show you how you can implement this algorithm on top of scikit-learn, and how you can apply it to tune a machine learning model. I'll also discuss some common gotcha's and other things to watch out for.\n \nAlways wondering why your models are not winning any Kaggle competitions? Randomly guessing model parameters might work for some, but not everybody gets that lucky! In this talk, we'll look at a way of optimising machine learning models, than random search.. We'll build up some intuition about how Bayesian optimisation with Gaussian processes works, and how we can implement it using scikit-learn.", "Static Type Analysis for Robust Data Products\n \nAs a dynamically typed language, Python is an extremely flexible tool that allows to write code quickly and concisely. This flexibility makes Python a popular tool for R&D and prototyping, but what about bringing Data Science in production? When comparing Python to statically typed languages, one of the downsides is that many type-related errors are not captured until runtime.\nThis talk discusses the steps taken by the Python community to promote static type analysis, in particular the semantic definition of type hints and the adoption of mypy as type checking tool. \nThe audience will learn about static typing for Python, its pros and cons, and how to adopt static type analysis in your workflow. Since the focus is on building and deploying data products, static type analysis is discussed as a mean to improve the robustness of your data products.\n \nThis talk discusses static type analysis applied to Python data products, its pros and cons, and overall how to adopt type checking tools (i.e. mypy) in your workflow.", "Machine Learning in Financial Credit Risk Assessment\n \nCredit Risk assessment is a general term used among financial institutions to describe the methodology used to determine the likelihood of loss on a particular asset, investment or loan. The objective of assessing credit risk is to determine if an investment is worthwhile, what steps should be taken to mitigate risk, and what the return rate should be to make an investment successful. \nBuilding a Credit Risk Prediction Model as accurate as possible becomes essential, as it allows the institution to provide fair prices to the customers while ensuring predictable and minimal losses. We build our Credit Risk Model by combining data gathered from the customer\u2019s application on our online platform with their credit history provided by different credit agencies. \nIn this talk, we will cover the research and development behind our recently created Credit Risk Model.

Inside of PP, a lot of innovation is in making things scale using Variational Inference. In this talk , I will show how to use Variational Inference in PyMC3 to fit a simple Bayesian Neural Network. I will also discuss how bridging Probabilistic Programming and Deep Learning can open up very interesting avenues to explore in future research.\nProbabilistic Programming\nProbabilistic Programming allows very flexible creation of custom probabilistic models and is mainly concerned with insight and learning from your data. The approach is inherently Bayesian so we can specify priors to inform and constrain our models and get uncertainty estimation in form of a posterior distribution. Using MCMC sampling algorithms we can draw samples from this posterior to very flexibly estimate these models. PyMC3 and Stan are the current state-of-the-art tools to consruct and estimate these models. \nOne major drawback of sampling, however, is that it's often very slow, especially for high-dimensional models. That's why more recently, variational inference algorithms have been developed that are almost as flexible as MCMC but much faster. Instead of drawing samples from the posterior, these algorithms instead fit a distribution (e.g. normal) to the posterior turning a sampling problem into and optimization problem. ADVI -- Automatic Differentation Variational Inference -- is implemented in PyMC3 and Stan, as well as a new package called Edward which is mainly concerned with Variational Inference.\nIn this talk we'll apply these methods of Variational Inference to regression and neural network problems, and explain the advantages for solving big data problems in probabilistic programming. You'll leave this talk with methods you can apply in your own work, and will showcase some of the new features in PyMC3 and Edward.\nThe speakers are both contributors to PyMC3.\n \nRecent improvements in Probabilistic Programming have led to a new method called Variational Inference.

In recent years Python has evolved as a standard tool in astronomy and cosmology due to the availability of open source statistical analysis and machine learning packages that allow the development of robust data analysis pipelines and powerful visualisations. In this session, I\u2019d like to demonstrate how a beginner to the field of cosmology can use open data along with the Jupyter Notebook to visualise and analyse real cosmological data, using easy to implement code examples from well known python packages such as AstroML, scipy, healpy, numpy, pymc, scikit-learn and matplotlib.\n \nCurrent cosmology experiments face exciting computational challenges in statistics and machine learning, with large amounts of data to process.

In this talk I will first introduce basic concepts of political polling design methodologies and traditional analytical techniques for dealing with the necessarily skewed data that results from traditional sampling. I will then give an overview of existing Python packages for tackling survey design and demonstrate sample code applying existing packages and also roll-your-own approaches. I will discuss current industry best practice for polling and explain how these traditional methods were deployed to monitor the year's two biggest political votes: the US Presidential election and the UK Brexit referendum.\nI will explore how, and whether, the outcomes of these two votes was as much as a surprise to pollsters as the media indicated and what might have led to more accurate predictions. Finally, I will close with comments about how polling methodology is likely to change in the coming years and what, if anything, could have been done differently analytically to better predict the actual results of these important 2016 votes.\n \n2016 was a whopper of a year both for political upsets and debates about traditional polling and its relevance. In this talk I will discuss Pythonic survey analysis and will also highlight the pitfalls of polling and sampling generally.

In practice, the workflow includes (1) selecting and/or engineering the smallest and most predictive feature set, (2) choosing a set of algorithms from a model family, and (3) tuning the algorithm hyperparameters to optimize performance. Recently, much of this workflow has been automated through grid search methods, standardized APIs, and GUI-based applications. In practice, however, human intuition and guidance can more effectively hone in on quality models than exhaustive search.\nThis talk presents a new Python library, Yellowbrick, which extends the Scikit-Learn API with a visual transfomer (visualizer) that can incorporate visualizations of the model selection process into pipelines and modeling workflow. Yellowbrick is an open source, pure Python project that extends Scikit-Learn with visual analysis and diagnostic tools. The Yellowbrick API also wraps matplotlib to create publication-ready figures and interactive data explorations while still allowing developers fine-grain control of figures. For users, Yellowbrick can help evaluate the performance, stability, and predictive value of machine learning models, and assist in diagnosing problems throughout the machine learning workflow. \nIn this talk, we'll explore not only what you can do with Yellowbrick, but how it works under the hood (since we're always looking for new contributors!). We'll illustrate how Yellowbrick extends the Scikit-Learn and Matplotlib APIs with a new core object: the Visualizer. Visualizers allow visual models to be fit and transformed as part of the Scikit-Learn Pipeline process - providing iterative visual diagnostics throughout the transformation of high dimensional data.\n \nYellowbrick is a new library that extends Scikit-Learn's API to incorporate visualizations into machine learning. While the machine learning workflow is increasingly being automated with gridsearch, APIs, and GUIs, in practice, human intuition outperforms exhaustive search. By visualizing model selection, we can not only steer towards robust models, but also avoid common pitfalls and traps.", "KEYNOTE: Picasso's terminal; data science and AI in the visual arts\n \nOver the past several years, two trends in machine learning have converged to pique the curiosity of artists working with code: the proliferation of powerful open source deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and Torch, and the emergence of data-intensive generative models for hallucinating images, sounds, and text as though they came from the oeuvre of Shakespeare, Picasso, or just a gigantic database of digitized cats. This talk will review these developments and offer a set of interdisciplinary tools and learning resources for artists and data scientists alike, if ever there was a difference to begin with.\n \nA talk about the flourishing intersection between machine learning and art, a survey of recent works emerging from it, and a primer on how to get started with it for seasoned developers and newcomers alike.", "Diversity and Data: Cases in the Music Industry\n \nI would like to present a few challenging questions that I have encountered at PPL:\n\n\nRolling up music and musicians: for instance, Beyonce, Bey, Queen Bee, Beyonce feat. Jay-Z, Beyonc\u00e9 feat jayz all should ideally come under the parent of Beyonc\u00e9. A lot has to do with normalising the strings. But an additional layer, with large potential for improving the predictive power, is introducing aliases and leveraging PPL's as well as external third-party data to identify potential aliases. \n\n\nIdentifying turning-point collaborations: which partnerships among musicians are most likely to change their careers significantly? This involves looking at: firstly, whether music collaborations (including band memberships) are changing in nature. Secondly, asking how to identify the value added of collaborators, i.e. the effect of certain collaborations on the artist's profile, recognition and success.\n\n\nHow to identify outliers at the artist level? The distribution of many variables of interest (band memberships, active years etc.) is highly heterogeneous across artists, and contain a few suspicious outliers that are hard to identify from aggregate distributions.\n\n\n \nWith lower barriers to entry and rise of streaming, the volume of new songs and artists is exponentially increasing. Given these trends in the music industry, I would like to look at a few challenging problems I encountered at PPL. Solving these problems will improve the efficiency with which we churn through millions of observations and therefore minimise any delay in allocations of royalties.", "How distributed representations make chatbots work  (at least a bit)\n \nIt is hard to go anywhere on the web these days without encountering chatbots and other natural language interfaces. But how do these bots actually understand what you say? It turns out it can be boiled down to a simple recipe: you need to know which words mean similar things! This sounds straight-forward, but efficient ways of doing this, namely distributed representations, were only just discovered in the past few years of machine learning research. They have immense potential and we are only beginning to realise what we can do with them.\nIn this talk I want to outline how distributed representations are used at babylon health, and how everyone can incorporate sophisticated language understanding into their applications with just a few lines of python. Furthermore I will give a glimpse of the research we are doing, some of which we just published in a paper at ICLR.\nSimple outline of the talk:\n What are distributed representations and how do they work?\n What are they good for, what are they bad at?\n Some examples on how we use them at babylon health\n Some interesting results from our research\nI will do my best to give practical examples throughout the talk and will provide python snippets in an accompanying repository, which should make this talk accessible to a wide audience!\n \nChatbots are all the hype right now, like it or not. In this talk I want to take a look under the hood and show you how simple it is today to incorporate sophisticated language understanding in your applications. The tool of choice are distributed representations, also known as word vectors, which allow us to answer the most crucial question: which of these words mean similar things?", "Machine learning with ventilator data to improve reporting on critically ill newborn infants\n \nMechanical ventilators are widely used in intensive care. Even two decades ago they were be primarily mechanical devices whose \"only\" task was to inflate the patient\u2019s lung. Recently, however, they have become equipped with powerful computers that provide sophisticated ventilator modes. Data provided by the ventilators are almost never downloaded, stored or analysed. The data is complex, high frequency and requires time-intensive scrutiny to review. Doctors do not have time to analyse these traces in a neonatal unit.\nWe are providing a simple and easy-to-interpret summary of 100Hz dual-channel ventilator data to improve the quality of care of young infants by time-poor staff. This involves signal processing, visualisation, building a gold standard and machine learning to segment breaths and summarise a baby's behaviour. This builds on our talk at PyDataLondon Meetup 30 in January 2017. Our goal is to open source the research so that others can benefit from the processes that we develop. We invite feedback from the audience to help improve our methods.\nAnyone interested in time series data, automated labeling, scikit-learn, Bokeh and medical applications will find this talk of interest. Both the highs and lows of our current approaches will be discussed.\nThis is a collaboration between Dr Gusztav Belteki (Cambridge University Hopsitals NHS Foundation Turst), Ian Ozsvald (ModelInsight) and Giles Weaver (ModelInsight).\n \nMechanical ventilators are widely used in intensive care, they are sophisticated but Doctors do not have time to analyse the copious traces of data in a neonatal unit.

If you need higher-level (e.g. complex models) or lower-level (e.g. custom gradients or GPU kernels) control than the framework provides, you get stuck.\nJulia's mix of performance and ease of use opens a radical alternative; a single language that can work at all levels, from GPUs to data processing pipelines to clusters. Different approaches can be freely mixed and matched, with transparency and control at all levels of the stack. Come see how these ideas can accelerate your current workflow, and get a glimpse of the future of ML in Julia.\n \nJulia's well-known combination of ease-of-use, performance and powerful features make it uniquely suited to the toughest machine learning problems. We'll illustrate how Julia can accelerate your current workflow, show you the groups running intelligent Julia code in production, and discuss our plans for the future.", "A laser light show on a quantum scale\n \nLaser light can be used to trap, cool and manipulate atoms and microscopic particles, with applications ranging from simulating quantum systems to real-time manipulation of single atoms or biomolecules. The development of new laser beam shaping methods is therefore imperative to the progress of research in a variety of fields within optics, atomic physics and biophotonics. \nSpatial light modulators offer a highly versatile method of time-dependent beam shaping, based on imprinting a phase profile onto an incident laser beam that determines the intensity and phase distribution of the trapping plane laser field. Any desired trapping plane field must therefore be expressed in terms of the corresponding input plane phase, a phase retrieval problem that can be solved by methods falling broadly into two categories: iterative Fourier transform algorithms, and those based on the minimisation of a cost function. I will present a versatile approach that falls into the latter category, describing how we use a conjugate gradient minimisation routine implemented in Python to directly target specific output plane features of interest. By using the Theano library to determine the cost function gradient, we have drastically streamlined the process of assessing cost function suitability, making possible our recent implementation of the simultaneous and independent control of both the intensity and phase of the trapping plane optical field. This latest development grants an extra dimension to our control of light field structure, and thus our ability to manipulate the properties of trapped particles.\n \nPrecise shaping of laser light is crucial to trapping and manipulating ultracold atoms, with critical implications for quantum computing, quantum simulation and precision measurements. I will discuss a Python-based approach to the beam shaping problem that maximises our control of trapped particles.", "Journeys through JuPyteR\n \nIn the last few years notebooks have become de rigeur within data science, and the ability to mix & match different languages is one of many exciting elements within them. Using as a motto \u2018find the best tool for the job\u2019 we will take the Python code from Tariq Rashid\u2019s book \u201cMake your own Neural Network\u201d and, using the MNIST data set, rewrite it in R and Julia. Of particular interest will be the idiosyncrasies that we see within each language as well as the readability and speed of each.\n \nThere have been many talks about Jupyter notebooks but rather than concentrating on the notebook this talk will look at three data science languages available within it: Jula, Python and R. This talk will be aimed at beginner coders where we will write code in all three languages and discuss the differences between them.", "SaaaS - Sampling as an Algorithm Service\n \nA lot of people understand the scikit-learn models of todays world but feel uneasy about the whole MCMC method of training. Why are these algorithms different? How is it that you don't use a gradient method but a sampler instead? It can feel a bit misterious if you've not properly been introduced to this other way of thinking.\nIn this talk I will explain the idea of sampling to get to your model and I will demonstrate it with examples. The goal is to start with a for loop and to end with understanding how MCMC algorithms work. As a consequence the audience will also get a proper introduction to PyMC3. In particular I will discuss the following;\n\nwhy markov chain sampling can be equivalent to direct sampling\nhow to build your own MCMC sampler with a for loop\nhow this for loop can be run faster by using PyMC3 instead\nthe key idea of inference and how i was briefly able apply it in a santa kaggle competition\nhow to analyse timeseries with MCMC in PyMC3\n\nParts of this talk are readily available on my blog;\n\nhttps://koaning.io/switching-to-sampling-in-order-to-switch.html\nhttps://koaning.io/elimination-via-inference.html\n\nLet me know if there are any questions.

Data products for manufacturing at shop floor\n \nPirelli has a 140 year old tradition of manufacturing with 20 factories across 14 countries and headquarter office in Milan. Production flows, logistic, machinery and the whole extended value chain has morphed through decades across a broad range of needs and circumstances.\nThe creation of a Data Science and Analytics department at the beginning of  2016 has the goal of speeding up change and innovation, starting from areas that are harder to tackle. Some of the most interesting challenges include:\n\nbring data products at shop floor to increase efficiency while being aware of UX principles\nkeep 2-sided communication alive with wide number of actors, particularly with IT, quality and engineering\nencourage active participation by providing accessible analytics tools and an internal Academy training program\nactivate the virtuous circle of prototyping, feasibility check and production releases for sound product lifecycles\nintroduce Agile development methodologies in traditional waterfall environments\nshape a roadmap with principal stakeholders starting from off-line through live analysis and heading to ahead-of-time predictions\n\nopening a steady communication channel across groups is progressively eroding barriers between white and blue collars, allowing teams to better understand each other requirements and kicking off a broader conversation. At the end of the first year since releasing the first prototype, there is much more on the plate, and groups are now more familiar with concepts of User Experience, release lifecycle, data exploration and agile development.\nOutline\nIn this talk we are going to show the data science team approach to prototyping and implementation of data products for Pirelli factories, both at shop floor and quality / engineering offices. Different needs or - taking a UX approach - different personas, lead to different outcomes: from large displays mounted in wide warehouses to detailed descriptions of statistical distributions, from near real-time processing of streams of data coming out of sensors to large computations for statistical models made on millions of rows stored in sql tables. \nThe sheer variety of technologies involved in the process is probably the biggest challenge when deploying at production level: aside standard data processing and machine learning packages, such as Pandas and scikit-learn, our Flask and Django based web infrastructures interact with MsSQL servers, JBoss data virtualisers, a Hadoop cluster and Oracle data warehouse, responsively adapting their output for different contexts with Angular and React front-ends.\nThe introduction of data products has triggered a little revolution allowing to improve and widen the offer of internal training via an Academy program, in search of competences inside the factories for all people willing to open an editor and write some Python and Javascript.\n \nThe Data Science and Analytics group at Pirelli has to deal with factories' day to day that can't be further from the aseptic crunching of data from a keyboard in an office. Our group took the lift, went down at shop floor and started asking questions to try and make their life better: turns out questions flowed the other way round and results were startling.", "To explain or to predict?\n \nThe goal of statistical modelling is to build a relationship between the observational data and the phenomenon under investigation. Predictive and explanatory modelling are sub-branches of statistical modelling that optimise for prediction or explaination respectively.\nThe data science and machine learning literature is filled with examples of predictive modelling approaches while other disciples like economists are almost solely reliant on explanatory methods.\nIn theory a model that explains your dataset well should come with high predictive capabilities but in reality it has been shown that this is not the case. This leads to a different set of optimisations and tradeoffs during modelling.\nThe goal of this talk is to discuss these different tradeoffs and showcase the similarities and differences between these approaches as well as to discuss when is best to use one over the other.\n \nData science and machine learning in particular has a preference towards the kind of statistical modelling that optimises for prediction rather than explanation. Understanding which variables correlate with the phenomenon you are investigating is an inherent part of both approaches but models with high explanatory power are not necessarily the ones that yield the best predictions.", "KEYNOTE: Data for good: Lessons from the frontline\n \nMost of us will know data for business as the art and science of using proprietary data to solve high value commercial problems. But how can those same techniques be used to solve societal problems as well? From tackling money laundering through network statistics to establishing the true scale of youth homelessness through Bayesian inference, DataKind UK will share examples of how they\u2019ve partnered with charities to use data for good. Reflecting on what has and hasn\u2019t worked in three years, they will share the critical success factors they\u2019ve identified along the way.\n \nDataKind UK share their experiences and critical success factors from 3 years of learning-by-doing in using data in the service of humanity.", "Recommender systems with Tensorflow\n \nRecommender systems are used across the digital industry to model users' preferences and increase engagement. Popularised by the seminal Netflix prize, collaborative filtering techniques such as matrix factorisation are still widely used, with modern variants using a mix of meta-data and interaction data in order to deal with new users and items. We will demonstrate how to implement a variety of models using Tensorflow, from simple bi-linear models expressed as shallow neural nets to the latest deep incarnations of Amazon DSSTNE and Youtube neural networks. We will also use TensorBoard and particularly the embedding projector to visualise the latent space for items and metadata.\n \nThis talk will demonstrate how to harness a deep-learning framework such as Tensorflow, together with the usual suspects such as Pandas and Numpy, to implement recommendation models for news and classified ads.", "Efficient and portable DataFrame storage with Apache Parquet\n \nSince its creation in 2013, Apache Parquet has risen to be the most widely used binary columnar storage format in the big data processing space. While supporting basic attributes of a columnar format like reading a subset of columns, it also leverages techniques to store the data efficiently while providing fast access. In addition the format is structured in such a fashion that when supplied to a query engine, Parquet provides indexing hints and statistics to quickly skip over chunks of irrelevant data.\nIn recent months, efficient implementations to load and store Parquet files in Python became available, bringing the efficiency of the format to Pandas DataFrames. While this provides a new option to store DataFrames, it especially allows us to share data between Pandas and a lot of other popular systems like Apache Spark or Apache Impala. In this talk we will show the improvements that Parquet bring performance-wise but also will highlight important aspects of the format that make it portable and efficient for queries on large amount of data. As not all features are yet available in Python, an overview of the upcoming Python-specific improvements and how the Parquet format will be extended in general is given at the end of the talk.\n \nApache Parquet is the most used columnar data format in the big data processing space and recently gained Pandas support. It leverages various techniques to store data in a CPU and I/O efficient way and provides capabilities to push-down queries to the I/O layer. In this talk, it is shown how to use it in Python, detail its structure and present the portable usage with other tools.", "Is having dementia linked to where you live?\n \nOverview\nAlzheimer\u2019s is a neurodegenerative disease that currently affects over 55 million people worldwide and this is set to increase with trends in population growth and demographics.  Meanwhile, particulate emission levels in large cities across Europe and the world have been under scrutiny, as diesel emissions related to a huge uptick in diesel vehicle purchases (due to governments' push to reduce CO2 emission levels) are found to have caused many medical problems in the area of breathing difficulties.\nBreathing function and the lungs may not be the only parts affected; there is now more than one scientific study (see link [1] for an example below) that has found a link between higher incidence of dementia (in particular Alzheimer\u2019s) in those who have lived in highly polluted urban areas for large periods of their lives. \nThis talk is about a short, collaborative \u2018hack\u2019 project with a focus on using Python machine learning tools and open data to test this hypothesis and look for evidence either confirming or denying the link between increased diesel engine and tyre particulate emissions (PM10, PM2.5 and NO2) in a given residential area with a greater likelihood of diagnosis of dementia amongst the residents of that area. \nThe idea behind this endeavour is that this \u2018pilot\u2019 study might enable a funded venture to take root that, for example, increases awareness of the true impact of high diesel car pollution in dense conurbations.\nQuestions asked\n\nCan we visualize the likelihood of incidence of dementia per person on a heat map for a city or for the UK? And similarly visualize annual particulate exposure per resident? Do they look similar?\nDo various sources of data, when placed under the magnifying glass of data science corroborate the evidence gathered by recent studies?\nCan a classifier reasonably determine the likelihood of your contracting dementia based on where you have lived mostly during your life?\nWhere should you live and work that gives you a lower chance of contracting Alzheimer\u2019s later in life?\nHow can the findings be used to push city officials to improve city air quality? How can we raise awareness?\n\nChallenges encountered on the way\n\nHow to interpolate, in order to cover 'gaps' in-between emission monitoring stations, incorporating additional data sources (for example road network structure and traffic intensity levels)?\nSensitive medical data; how to merge open medical datasets securely without revealing personal information?\nWhich types of machine learning models are best suited to this problem?  \n\nApproach\nStarting at a high level, it is possible to determine if there is a higher incidence of dementia cases linked with an increase in airborne pollutants (diesel source):\n\nAt a country level (e.g. for the Netherlands or the UK)\nAt a city level (e.g. for Bristol, Eindhoven and / or London)\nAt a borough level (e.g. for Camden, London)\nAt a street level (by postcode)\nAt individual sufferer level (with de-personalized datasets, based on 1,000 blog posters)\n\nOther research inputs (articles and papers)\n[1] https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/01/brain-pollution-evidence-builds-dirty-air-causes-alzheimer-s-dementia\n \nIn this talk we will explore the results from a short, collaborative \u2018hack\u2019 project with a focus on using Python machine learning tools and open data to find evidence linking increased diesel engine and tyre particulate emissions (PM10, PM2.5 and NO2) in certain residential areas with greater likelihood of diagnosis of dementia amongst the residents of that area.", "Extracting Insight From A Muslim Marriage App\n \nDating apps have become the norm in modern society, with companies like Tinder, Bumble, Happn etc. boasting millions of users. OKCupid, an early entry into the online world of dating, were one of the leading companies to take advantage of the data at their fingertips and conducted several interesting experiments and subsequent data analysis which were published on their blog and subsequently in the book 'Cataclysm' by their lead data scientist Christian Rudder. \nI was curious to see how people interact when searching for love online when they are part of a (1) organized religion and (2) members of a minority. I teamed up with Shahzad Younus, founder of the muslim marriage app 'MuzMatch' to gather highly anonymized data about their users and extract insight into how people behave and what is important to them. For example, as an app targeted at members of a specific religious community, does levels of religiosity really matter? Does religion trump ethnicity? \nI hope to answer these questions and more.\n \nI use various Python libraries and methods from Graph theory and Information Retrieval to garner insight into the social dynamics of people searching for love and marriage on the Muslim marriage app 'MuzMatch'.", "Bayesian Deep Learning with Edward (and a trick using Dropout)\n \nDeep learning methods represent the state-of-the-art for many applications such as speech recognition, computer vision and natural language processing.  Conventional approaches generate point estimates of deep neural network weights and hence make predictions that can be overconfident since they do not account well for uncertainty in model parameters.  However, having some means of quantifying the uncertainty of our predictions is often a critical requirement in fields such as medicine, engineering and finance.  One natural response is to consider Bayesian methods, which offer a principled way of estimating predictive uncertainty while also showing robustness to overfitting.  \nBayesian neural networks have a long history.  Exact Bayesian inference on network weights is generally intractable and much work in the 1990s focused on variational and Monte Carlo based approximations [1-3].  However, these suffered from a lack of scalability for modern applications.  Recently the field has seen a resurgence of interest, with the aim of constructing practical, scalable techniques for approximate Bayesian inference on more complex models, deep architectures and larger data sets [4-10].\nEdward is a new, Turing-complete probabilistic programming language built on Python [11].  Probabilistic programming frameworks typically face a trade-off between the range of models that can be expressed and the efficiency of inference engines.  Edward can leverage graph frameworks such as TensorFlow to enable fast distributed training, parallelism, vectorisation, and GPU support, while also allowing composition of both models and inference methods for a greater degree of flexibility. \nIn this talk I will give a brief overview of developments in Bayesian deep learning and demonstrate results of Bayesian inference on deep architectures implemented in Edward for a range of publicly available data sets.  Dropout is an empirical technique which has been very successfully applied to reduce overfitting in deep learning models [12].  Recent work by Gal and Ghahramani [13] has demonstrated a surprising formal equivalence between dropout and approximate Bayesian inference in neural networks.  I will compare some results of inference via the machinery of Edward with model averaging over neural nets with dropout training. \n[1] D JC MacKay.

ICML, 2016\n \nBayesian neural networks have seen a resurgence of interest as a way of generating model uncertainty estimates. I use Edward, a new probabilistic programming framework extending Python and TensorFlow, for inference on deep neural nets for several benchmark data sets.  This is compared with dropout training, which has recently been shown to be formally equivalent to approximate Bayesian inference.", "Segmenting Channel 4 Viewers using LDA Topic Modelling\n \nWe wanted to tailor the All 4 experience to the different types of people we know use our service. If, as we suspect, viewing preferences are a reflections of personality, then perhaps the different types of people we wish to cater for can be identified by looking at their viewing behaviour on All 4?\nTraditionally topic models expect a corpus of documents as an input, here we substitute documents for viewers and words for views. The patterns (topics) identified are consequently patterns in viewing.\nMllibs LDA topic model is used to recognize these patterns in our viewers\u2019 behaviour on All 4 and allows us to segment them based on how closely aligned their viewing is with each of the topics found.\nThe model is updated periodically using an online variational Bayes algorithm, which processes a subset of the corpus on each iteration, and updates the term-topic distribution adaptively, allowing us to incorporate new shows (n\u00e9e: words).\nDemographic information on our viewers is overlaid to understand gender and age splits of the segments whilst survey data from a subset of each enriches our idea of the flavours of viewer in each group.\nThis sums to a detailed picture of the distinct groups of viewers we serve and affords us the opportunity to tailor the service we provide, hopefully, for the better.\n \nIn this talk I will walk through how we used LDA Topic Modelling to segment Channel 4 viewers based on their online viewing behaviour. Combining segment viewing with demographic information and interests/hobbies/lifestyles from survey data provides a wonderfully nuanced understanding of our viewers and allows us to tailor comms, All4, commissioned content, and recommendations to specific tastes.", "\"Lights, camera, AI!\" -  Automated sports videography\n \nInspired by the shaky camera work of friends and parents  alike in school sports events; I've build a Raspberry Pi controlled robot that automatically points a camera at where the action is happening in a rugby match. \nThe talk will discuss the stages of developing an embedded machine vision model. Starting with a simple heuristic approach in order to collect the training data. Then how you can compress the feature space in order to reduce the computational load on the Raspberry Pi. Along with that, how using python multi-processing can help in sharing the load of the machine vision work and servo control.\nAfter the talk people should know a little about embedding machine learning using Raspberry Pi's as well as some insight in to SimpleCV (machine vision library for python) and multi-processing with python.\n \nAmateur sports video quality usually depends on how good your friends are with their camera-phone. In this talk I walk through the stages of how I designed and developed a machine vision model for tracking where the action is happening in a rugby match, and how I made it lightweight enough to run on a Raspberry Pi in real-time .", "Astrophysics to data Science: how the Milky Way is like my company.\n \nWhat happens when you move to a company which is no longer a start-up but still not established? When I moved to Data science, I choose a company which had been around for 10 years, as a small-medium sized Enterprise (SME) but the data science team was brand new (and both of us had moved from academia for this, our first data science job). \nYou don't have the excitement of a start-up: everything is new, let's try that, you can build the structures from the ground up. You don't have the structures of a bigger older company: there are things in place for you to work with, you know what's expected.\nInstead you have the best and worst of both worlds: starting a data team but no one understands how to use data. You get to put those structures in place, but have to shoe horn them into everyone else's. \nBut middle sized companies are like our Milky Way in many ways:  numerous, survive in many different environments, and you find them everywhere! \nSo what can you use from academia? Some things (like being able to communicate with a wide range of people) will be exceptionally useful. In a SME you will be expected to do this straight away, more than you might in a large company and with more people than you would find in a start-up.\nBut you have a great mixture of guidance (like from a large company) and leeway to invent (like from a start-up) on projects but you need to prove your worth quickly, which means creating useful products. So you need to break that habit of spending hours researching and not getting anything \"done\".\nSo here are some lessons learnt about the differences and how to use your academic experience to get the best of both worlds, not the worst.\n \nThe Milky Way is your average galaxy. There are thousands of them out there. Just like a medium size company. Not too young, not too old but has its own set of unique challenges no one ever mentioned.\nHard earned lessons of moving from Academia to data science in industry in your average sized company.", "Ranking hotel images using deep learning\n \nAttractive hotel images can influence the hotels that customers book online. However,selecting the best images is not a trivial problem, as there are tens of million images,and each customer can have their own image preferences (e.g. family vs. business customer). Displaying the best images for each hotel would have a significant impact on conversion. In this talk we will cover how Expedia has been ranking hotel images using deep learning techniques in Python.\n \nIn this talk we will cover how Expedia has been ranking hotel images using deep learning techniques in Python.", "Find the text similiarity you need with next generation of word embeddings in Gensim\n \nWhat is the most similar word to \"king\"? It depends on what you mean by similar. \"King\" can be interchanged with \"Canute\", but it's attribute is \"crown\". We will discuss how to achieve these two kinds of similarity from word embeddings.\nAlso touch on how to deal with the common issues of rare, frequent and out of vocabulary words.\n \nThere are many ways to find similar words/docs with  an open-source Natural Language processing library Gensim that I maintain.  I will give an overview of modern word embeddings like Google's Word2vec, Facebook's FastText, GloVe, WordRank, VarEmbed and discuss what business tasks fit them best.", "Outlier detection methods for detecting cheaters in mobile gaming\n \nOutlier and anomaly detection is an interesting and much used area of statistics. Its application ranges from fighting fraudulent transactions in finance, detecting anomalies in data systems and in data ingestion quality assurance.\nIn this talk I\u2019ll be describing an alternative example application of detecting cheaters within mobile games. I\u2019ll be discussing the motivation around detection and what in particular we are trying to detect - detecting every facet of cheating behaviour is not necessary; cheating that gives a negative experience to other users is particularly undesirable.\nPart of this talk will go into the various approaches to outlier detection:\nSingle variate heuristics\nDensity based approaches in multivariate data (e.g. minimum volume ellipsoid)\nNeural network methods (auto-encoders and replicator neural networks)\nI will also explore the actual implementation issues and solutions in the particular example of mobile games. In the Free-to-play market, the majority of our users enjoy the game for free - with a minority making up the player base that spends on in-app purchases. Because of this, our highest value customers can often look like outliers alongside cheaters. Getting those sets of users mixed up is highly undesirable so some manual intervention is needed to make sure there are very little or no false positives.\n \nIt has become increasingly difficult to detect cheaters in mobile games. As the complexity of games grow, so do the different methods of cheating. As users realise the boundaries of simple mechanisms they find more nuanced ways to cheat the system. In this talk I will be taking you through a number of detection methods and discussing implications and implementation in the real world.", "WTF am I doing?  An introduction to NLP and ANN's\n \nCollecting data is more fun when it's about myself: I'm an expert! So I program my computer to spy on me.  And then I play with the data, the better to understand both ML techniques and what I've been up to.  In the limit, I try not only to understand how I spend my time but also to predict how I am about to spend my time.\nConsider the active window on my computer: the window with which I am currently interacting.  Watching the window name creates a sequence of window titles and a great NLP playground.  (\"Natural language\" is here a discovered irony.)  Snapshotting the contents of the window in turn creates long sequences of images.  To save space, I reduce the images to postage stamp size, and yet it turns out I can learn some very interesting things nonetheless.  Some reasonably simple neural networks are enough to discern how I spend my time, when I work on which projects.  Indeed, well beyond providing a great playground for learning about ML techniques, the project also provides a good reminder (warning?) about how much we can learn from what appear to be relatively scant data.  Of course, the links in the final slides will share all the code to help you get started with projects of your own.\n \nThis talk will be a playful but serious introduction to natural language processing and image processing with (artificial) neural networks.", "Analyzing 3D objects with power of Deep Learning and Cython\n \nWe live in great time for development of Machine Learning algorithms. There is an abundance of ways to implement models, a lot of them are in Python or have a python API. Python is a great way to implement high level APIs and connect your code to other parts of data processing. Learning how to write in Theano or Tensorflow can be very helpful for most of the people facing problems with complex data. But for a niche area like Deep Learning for sparse 3D data there was no solutions.  Our python module enables creation of deep neural networks to process sparse data quickly using combination of Python and fast C++/CUDA code underneath. \nIn my talk I'll explain how to connect high performance code with practical user level abstractions using Cython, as it was done in our project.\nYou can see code in a github repository or checkout our paper.\n \nDeep Learning taken world by storm in recent years, and most of the time it's powered by Python language. Working with 3D data is computationally demanding even by most powerful GPUs. A lot of times 3D data is in sparse form, or can be turned without loosing too much of it's usefulness. We combined high performance of CUDA library with ease of use and power of Python by getting good with Cython.", "Building robust machine learning systems\n \nAs machine learning becomes more prevalent, ever growing parts of the systems we build are changing from the deterministic to the probabilistic. The accuracy of machine learning applications can quickly deteriorate in the wild without strategies for testing models, instrumenting their behaviour and the ability to introspect and debug incorrect predictions.\nThis session will take an applied view from my experience of building production machine learning infrastructure at Ravelin. You\u2019ll learn useful practices and tips to help ensure your machine learning systems are robust. We\u2019ll go into:\n\nLabels and Data - can you trust it? Can you infer them?\nTesting - how do you ensure your model is doing the basics, up to the more complicated examples?\nAuditing and versioning - what's the provenance of your model? What data was it trained on? With which hyper parameters? Can you reproduce it?\nDebugging and introspection when deployed - when you make an awful prediction, can you figure out why that happened and prevent it happening again?\n\nAnd more, with the aim of helping you sleep a little better at night knowing your model is out there in the wild.\n \nWith the growth of AI, ever growing parts of products we build are changing from the deterministic to the probabilistic. The accuracy of machine learning applications can deteriorate in the wild without strategies for testing, monitoring and introspection. You'll leave this talk knowing how to combine the best of software engineering and machine learning to build robust machine learning products.", "Smart search using Support vector machines\n \n Smart search using support vector machines\n Search is a common, if not an essential, feature of any digital app. A simple search engine should retrieve all the information that matches a user's query. But a smart search engine is one which also ranks the retrieved information in an order of relevance that is personalised. Machine learning classifiers such a support vector machines are a handy tool for implementing smart search. Using agile, data science practices such as test-driven development and paired programming in a balanced team, we have built a grocery delivery app, with smart search, for one of UK's largest supermarkets. This talk will discuss the approaches and lessons learnt from putting data science in production.\n\n \nSearch is a common, if not an essential, feature of an app. A good search has to retrieve the information that matches a user's query but a great search should also personalize the information to improve the overall relevance. This talk will share the lessons from a recent implementation of a smart search for a grocery delivery app for one of UK's largest supermarkets.", "Leveraging recommender systems to personalise search results\n \nThese days a lot of companies are building recommendations engines. The techniques for doing so are widely known and open source technology is accessible. We were experimenting to investigate how we can leverage our recommendations engine to extend personalisation to search results. Besides surfacing items that are relevant based on the search term our approach aims to increase relevancy for each user by considering their personal preferences. We use Pyspark to set up the data and calculate recommendation and preference elements and Elasticsearch as a search engine where we integrate our recommendations approach. We are looking into various ways of how to incorporate customer preferences such as item similarities, matrix factorisation output and preference inference.\n \nThis talk discuses an approach to personalise search results by leveraging techniques of recommender systems .We use Pyspark to set up the data and calculate recommendation and preference elements and Elasticsearch as a search engine", "Smelly London: visualising historical smells through text-mining, geo-referencing and mapping.\n \nSmelly London: visualising historical smells through text-mining, geo-referencing and mapping.\nThe Medical Officer of Health (MOH) reports were published annually by the Medical Officers of Health (MOsH) employed by local authorities across the UK. These reports provided vital statistics and a general statement on the health of the population. MOH reports concentrated on reporting infectious diseases and resolving the problems as well as covering other areas of social responsibilities. They have been long regarded as an important source for 19th and 20th century history of Public Health and stem from reaction to infectious disease in mid-19th century. Although there were attempts at standardisation, the reports display each MOH\u2019s interest, idiosyncrasies and particular strengths. Therefore, they also provide a particular perspective on the everyday lives of Londoners over several generations. \nOver the past few years Wellcome have been developing a world-class digital library by digitising a substantial proportion of their holdings. As part of this effort, approximately 5,800 MOH reports for London spanning from 1848-1972 were digitised in 2012. Currently Wellcome holds the most comprehensive digital collection of the London MOH reports. Since September 2016 Wellcome have been digitising 70,000 more reports covering the rest of the United Kingdom (UK) as part of UK Medical Heritage Library (UKMHL) project in partnership with Jisc and the Internet Archive. No digital techniques have yet been applied successfully to add value to this very rich resource.\nAs part of the [Smelly London] (www.londonsmells.co.uk) project , the OCR-ed text of the MOH London reports has been text-mined for the first time. Through text mining we produced a geo-referenced dataset containing smell types for visualisation to explore the data.  We enrich the text-mining pipeline with NLP, including lemmatization, part-of-speech tagging and automatic identification of smell terms and concepts based on their contextual features. This allows us to identify smell categories in a data-driven fashion and to discover new categories that escaped previous classifications. This step complements the close reading analysis and enables us to scale up the amount of information extracted from the texts.\nAnalysing the MOH reports tells the intimate narratives of the everyday experiences of 19th and 20th century Londoners through the \u2018smellscape\u2019. As the data becomes more structured, they can be more readily overlaid with other maps and images such as Charles Booth\u2019s London Poverty Map and 19th century disease maps. Having multiple layers will enable us to run various comparisons and assess if there are any correlations between smells and diseases as well as links to the socio-economic identity of areas in London. Smell has a great influence over how we perceive places and contribute to the construction of a place\u2019s identify. During the 19th century the paranoia surrounding smells associated with poor hygiene heightened in many European cities. The Great Stink of 1858 resulted in the discussion of moving Parliament outside London for example. Despite the rise of germ theory (Pasteur and Koch) in the 1880s, concerns with disease-causing miasma (smells) did not disappear entirely. The MOH reports are one of the richest available sources on local public health administration and patterns of disease.\nComputer programming can be used to perform tasks thousands of times faster than humans. In the Python code written to extract the data from the MOH reports, parallel processing was employed to speed up the running time of the program. Modern central processing units (CPUs) have multiple cores which allows the calculations to be run concurrently. In our project the CPU had four cores which allowed the running time of the program to be shortened by as much as three times. The next objective for the project is to scale up the size of the text-mining from 5,800 reports to over 70,000 reports covering the entire UK. In order to process such large datasets we are investigating using distributed computing resources such as Amazon Web Service (AWS). The code written for this project has been made open source under the MIT license along with documentation so that other programmers or researchers can use the codebase for use in their own text mining projects.\nAt the end of the Smelly London project the historical smell data will be available via 21st century [Smelly Maps] (https://www.goodcitylife.org/) by Daniele Quericia . This will allow the public and other researchers to compare smells in London from the 19th century to present day. Moreover, the Smelly London dataset will be available on the [Layers of London] (https://alpha.layersoflondon.org/the-map) project platform . This has the further potential benefit of engaging with the public.\n \nSmelly London project brings together historical data with modern digitisation and visualisation to give us a unique, revealing and visceral glimpse into a London of the past and what it tells us about London today. This is a collaborative, interdisciplinary project to demonstrate the capabilities of innovative text mining tools we design to facilitate new kinds of humanities research.", "An Algorithm of Style\n \nI will go into some detail about the types of algorithm and recommender system that have worked well, as well as those that have not! Interestingly we've found that some standard stalwarts of recommender systems have not thus far been a good fit for our data. I will describe some of the common pitfalls of deploying machine-learning systems in production (some of which we've avoided!), and emphasise the importance of using simple debuggable models when a stylist wants to know why The AI thinks it's a good idea to put a horizontal striped t-shirt on a larger gent.\n \nHow do eight stylists style half a million clients? At Thread we use machine-learning to help our stylists make personalised clothing recommendations to our users. In this talk I will give some insight into how we blend our stylists' expertise together with ML models that are continually learning from user feedback and sales data.", "Interactively Analyse 100GB of Data using Spark, Amazon EMR and Zeppelin\n \nYou may have been hearing a lot of buzz around Big Data, Apache Spark, Amazon Elastic Map Reduce (EMR) and Apache Zeppelin. What\u2019s the fuss about, and how can you benefit from these state of the art technologies?\nIn this highly interactive session, you will learn how to leverage Spark to rapidly mine a large real-world data set. We will conduct the analysis live entirely using an iPython Notebook to show you how easy it can be to get to grips with these technologies. \nIn the first part of the session, we will use a sample of data from the Open Library dataset, and you will learn how to apply common Spark patterns to extract insights and aggregate data. In the second part of the session, you will see how to leverage Spark on Amazon EMR to scale your data processing queries over a cluster of machines and interactively analyse a large data set (100GB) with a Zeppelin Notebook.

We will describe\n how we built word2vec and LDA models, what Word Mover's Distance is and how we tuned it to match questions to KB articles.\nWe will then go into detail about mixing different similarity approaches to build a search engine which performs better than Google's custom site search on our dataset.\nWe'll also state briefly how we applied gearman to run searches in parallel.\n-- Part Two: Knowing The Right Answer --\nA shortcoming of any search engine is that it lacks the knowledge of right and wrong answer. In order not to bother clients with very similar but not helpful\n articles, we created a classifier to tell the difference. We'll describe the specifics of building a supervised model for our task, along with it's \nfeatures and instances.\n \nFinding the knowledge base articles which hold answers to a customer's question can be hard. This talk is about our approach and how it grew with the amout of training \ndata we collected.

One tool that is gaining in popularity is agent-based modelling, in which a population of agents - typically representing individual people - is simulated together with an environment they can interact with. The agents' actions, which can in turn influence the other agents and the environment, are governed by a predetermined set of rules or heuristics. After much use in fields such as ecology and epidemiology these models are gaining increasing recognition in economics and policy, and were recently featured in the Bank of England's Quarterly Bulletin1. By running parallel simulations with modifications to the environment or the behavioural rules, a policy-maker can compare the likely outcomes of different options available to them.\nWe have used an agent-based model to assess the outcome of a change to the way in which wealth is inherited within families. The proposed change favours putting wealth into trust funds for grandchildren and great-grandchildren, instead of passing it directly to children. A similar proposal covering only houses was made last year by Gavin Barwell, the housing minister, but was not taken forward as government policy.\nWe developed a simulation of the demographic makeup of the UK, based on data from the census and the ONS, and inserted the different inheritance methods into it. We could then see what the long-term outcome of each scenario would be, in terms of the distribution of wealth and level of inequality in the country, allowing a quantitative assessment of its impact on individuals and society as a whole. The model also provides a base for developing assessments of more complex policies and interventions.\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/quarterlybulletin/2016/q4/a2.aspx\u00a0\u21a9\n\n\n\n \nAgent-based models, which simulate an entire population of interacting people or other agents, offer a promising approach to assessing the future social impact of government policy. I will describe one such case, looking at a proposed change in how wealth is inherited.", "Computational challenges of genome assembly, and how to beat them.\n \nGenome assembly is a cousin of string reconstruction, but the similarities stop very soon. Genomes are not random, they are  generated by evolution. This makes them simultaneously interesting and a pain to deal with. Sequencing data acquisition techniques vary, and evolve all the time, so you have to start from scratch every 3 or 4 years. DNA sequencing data production vastly outstrips Moore\u2019s law, and the nature of the genome sequence exasperates the explosion on many combinatorial methods, often presenting worst-case scenarios. Assembly algorithms are usually based on heuristics and are resource-hungry. Hence, the methods used are suboptimal, but they enable us to answer biological questions.\nHaving developed bioinformatics methods to enable us to analyse species\u2019 DNA, we move onto the question: how can we get better at big data processing? What genome assembly and bioinformatics show is that you not only do you need top notch computational skills, but actually knowing the nature of your data, its biases and how your results are going to be used allow you to slightly re-define problems in ways that make it more tractable.\nPart of the talk will focus on how to dramatically improve the performance of software without sacrificing the quality of the results. This will be relevant to anybody confronted with vast amounts of  error prone data, or legacy codebases which can no longer cope with the rate of data generation. In our case the performance depends on many factors; including the structure of the genome being assembled and the quality and quantity of sequencing data. One of our success stories is the open source assembly pipeline we use to cope with the massively big and repetitive bread wheat genome. We still need pretty big computers, but we now have  a stable codebase that produces robust results and has reduced RAM requirements from 9TB to 4TB, and runtimes from more than a month to around 10 days. This has taken over a year of intensive effort, which started with detailed profiling, and remains an ongoing task. The whole pipeline, which I will use as a case study in the talk, is open source and available at: https://github.com/bioinfologics/w2rap  and https://github.com/bioinfologics/w2rap-contigger and is used widely by genomic researchers. All the software we develop is open source, with either MIT or GPL licenses, and is available on our research team\u2019s github page: https://github.com/bioinfologics.\n \nI will give an introduction to genome assembly and the challenges it presents. I will include a brief synopsis of the journey from taking a few sample cells to producing a high standard 'reference genome' before moving onto the engineering challenges, with lessons applicable to all data intensive tasks.", "Dimension Reduction and Extracting Topics - A Gentle Introduction\n \nText mining and natural language processing are hugely powerful fields that can unlock insights into the vast amounts of human knowledge, creativity and drivel (!) for automated computing. Examples include the fun of highlighting trends in internet chatter through to more serious analysis of finding patterns and links in leaked data sets of public interest.\nOne key tool is to reduce the many dimensions of text data, and distill out the key themes in that text. People call this topic modelling, latent semantic analysis, and a few other names too. The powerful method at the heart of this is called singular value decomposition (SVD).\nThis talk will gently introduce singular valued decomposition (SVD), explaining the mathematics in an accessible manner, and demonstrate how it can be used, using the Chilcot Iraq Report as an example dataset.\nExample code, notebooks and data sets are public on GitHub, and there is a blog for more discussion of this, and other text mining ideas https://makeyourowntextminingtoolkit.blogspot.co.uk\n \nText mining has many powerful methods for unlocking insights into the messy, ambiguous, but interesting text created by people.\nSingular value decomposition (SVD) is a useful method for reducing the many dimensions of text data, and distill out key themes in that text - called topic modelling or latent semantic analysis.\nThis talk for beginners will gently explain SVD and how to use it.", "Introduction to data analysis with Pandas\n \nWhat will we do in the workshop\n\nReading CSV files.

These names are R packages created by RStudio's Chief Scientist Hadley Wickham. The tidyverse is a series of packages that work extremely well with each other and have been created with the aim of easing the data analysis process. As stated by its main author, the philosophy of the tidyverse is to allow the analyst to concentrate on the substantive questions rather than on technicalities of data analysis.\nIn this workshop we will discuss the philosophy behind the tidyverse. We will discuss why these packages work well together and how they complement each other. We will learn how to input data from softwares such as Excel, Stata and SPSS and we will spend most of the workshop  using the dplyr and ggplot2 packages in a real-world example.

All the examples are based on real-world performance problems that were found during the last year. Some of them are fairly trivial, but they are useful to explain why Python is slow, at least compared to other programming languages.\nIt's the same old story. One engineer designs a functionality for a client with test data, but once the real-world data arrives, the implementation is too slow. The code has to be refactored, but in the most isolated way possible. In addition, the client may have some constraints like not being able to compile extensions. The engineer calls someone more experienced in Python and the research begins. This workshop will be useful if you want to know some shortcuts.\nEven Pandas, that has a fairly good performance, can be seriously improved with some profiling, advanced Numpy tricks, Numexpr, the numba JIT compiler, or Cython extensions. In many of the examples the speedup is of two orders of magnitude.\nThe syllabus will be the following:\n\nWhy (stock) Python is slow. Deal with it.\nWhy Numpy is fast, if you use it properly. Numexpr may help sometimes.\nWhy Cython and Numba are fast, and how to keep them fast.\nWhy dates are hard and slow, but there are ways to deal with them.\nWhy O(2) computations in Pandas are slow, but if you are careful with allocations, they're not a great deal.\n\n \nWriting fast and memory efficient code in Python requires some experience, and some best practices are counter-intuitive if you come from static languages like C++ and Java.

While the specification may be used in a relatively simple way (persistence of static arrays) it also supports several high-level features that prove invaluable. These include chunking, ragged data, extensible data, parallel I/O, compression, complex selection, and more. Moreover, HDF5 bindings exist for almost every language - including two Python libraries (PyTables and h5py). This tutorial will cover HDF5 itself through the lens of both h5py and PyTables and will show how to use them in order to persist both NumPy and pandas containers.\nThis tutorial will discuss tools, strategies, and hacks for really squeezing every ounce of performance out of HDF5 in new or existing projects. It will also go over fundamental limitations in the specification and provide creative and subtle strategies for getting around them. We will also see how pandas can use HDF5 via its HDFStore module.  Overall, this tutorial will show how HDF5 plays nicely with all parts of an application making the code and data both faster and smaller. \nKnowledge of Python, NumPy, pandas, and basic HDF5 is recommended but not required.\nOutline\n\nIntro and setup (10 min)\nBasic datatypes (10 min)\nHomogeneous types (Arrays)\nCompound types (Tables)\n\n\nChunking (10 min)\nHow it works\nHow to properly select your chunksize\n\n\nMeaning in layout  (10 min)\nTips for choosing your hierarchy\n\n\nWhy you should always use compression (20 min)\nCompression algorithms (aka codecs) available\nChoosing the most adequate codec\nExercise\n\n\nQueries and Selections (30 min)\nPyTables.where()\nIndexed queries\nExercise\n\n\nIntegration with pandas (HDFStore) (20 min)\nStoring/loading dataframes\nQuerying a serialised dataframe\nExercise\n\n\n\n \nHDF5 is a hierarchical, binary database format that is extremely popular and includes features like chunking, ragged data, extensible data, parallel I/O, compression, complex selection, among others.

Scientific papers are usually accompanied by code repositories which rely on libraries as Theano or Tensorflow that can be interfaced from python. However, adapting a system to different tasks and data must take into account a set of pre-training routines and parameter debugging which we will discuss in this tutorial. Starting from the audio signals we introduce the data pre-training steps (feature computation, batch generation, normalization(  with examples in numpy or scipy. We summarize the core concepts in neural networks and we code an architecture with the Keras library.

Who doesn\u2019t check the rain radar before heading out, or the weather forecast when planning a weekend away? But where does this data come from, what is it made of, and what can you do with it? The answer is a mix of measurements, models and statistics. This session will use Python notebooks with examples of how it is done:\n\nWeather is quantified by the temperature, humidity, wind, rainfall and radiation. These variables are all measured at thousands of locations worldwide and all data is collected and checked to improve the weather forecasts. Learn how to interpolate this data to create for instance global temperature maps to estimate the global monthly and annual temperature.\nThe observations are used to constrain the global weather forecast models. These models are complex and simulate the energy, water and carbon fluxes between and in the atmosphere, ocean and land. The output from the models is gridded data, which is generally stored in binary netcdf files. Learn how to load and process the gridded data into time series or maps for further analysis.\nThe raw model data is processed for you when you request weather data through a REST API. Learn how to use a weather API to train a supervised model with historical weather time series and then use the weather forecast data to do predictions.\nThis session provides you with a brief overview of the science behind weather and climate forecasts and gives you the tools to get started with weather data.\n\n \nWeather is part of our every day lives.

Do you think that worrying about the morality of your work is something other people should do? If so, this talk is for you.\nIn this brief time, I will try to convince you that you hold great power over how the future world will look like and that you should incorporate thinking about morality into the set of ML tools you use every day. We will take a short journey through several problems, which surfaced over the last few years, as ML and AI generally, became more widely used. We will look at bias present in training data, at some real-world consequences of not considering it (including one or two hair-raising stories) and cutting-edge research on how to counteract this.\nThe outline of the talk is:\n\nIntro the problem: ML algos can be biased!\nTwo concrete examples.\nWhat's been done so far (i.e. techniques from recently-published papers).\nWhat to do next: unanswered questions.\n\n \nThere's a widespread belief among machine learning practitioners that algorithms are objective and allow us to deal with the messy reality in a nice, objective way, without worrying about all the yucky human nature things. This talk will argue that this belief is wrong. Algorithms, just like the humans who create them, can be severely biased and despicable indeed.", "How to manage complexity in distributed applications.\n \nThe development of large-scale distributed applications is an engineering challenge by itself. Development has to be orthogonal to be scalable, as you may know if you have heard about the Mythical Man-Month and the Conway's law: trying to make your application faster may slow down your development. Managing complexity is a new technology trend, and NFQ and the Carlos III University of Madrid have developed a library to make large-scale distributed applications more sensible called pylm (pylm.readthedocs.io). Since this library has been already used in production, it is time to summarize what are the challenges one faces when building something more intricate than a Spark cluster.\nThis talk is about the value of developing in-house tools and obtaining deep technological insight opposed to the successive integration of trendy technologies. The latter is suitable to implement one-shot tools for isolated projects, but when facing a multi-year complex project, the former becomes a more solid ground for long-term maintenance. Complexity piles up nonlinearly, and the most popular tools nowadays cringe when they have to be tightly integrated, since in the long term it is impossible to isolate the technical and the human aspects of development.\nComplexity's weight is getting heavier in this scalability-obsessed world, and it's time to talk about it.\nThis project has been funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitivity under the grant IDI-20150936, cofinanced with FEDER funds\n \nComplexity is tricky. Some years ago we got how to scale the performance of distributed applications, and that's why everyone is talking about Big Data.  But the challenge now is scaling the complexity within a fast-changing environment without penalizing the performance. These are the conclusions after one year developing a library trying to handle this issue, and using it in production.", "Machine Learning to know if you R coming\n \nSome users are more likely to cancel their bookings than others, depending on several factors/conditions.

We will explain what these features represent, and how they relate to other types of features that can be extracted directly from the database.\n\n\nImproving ML models: How to use graph features to boost machine learning models. We will talk about different feature selection techniques that can be used to filter out the most significant set of graph-based features using scikit-learn.\n\n\nVisualization: How to visualize social interactions using bokeh, and how visualization techniques can be used to check data integrity.\n\n\nWe will also review common mistakes that can happen during the modeling process and, how to prevent invalid data from getting leaked into your machine learning models. To conclude we compare the merits of using a Python framework versus R Language in terms of development time and computational performance.

Detailed example and implementation are provided in a jupyter notebook in python for the library \"xgboost\" of extreme gradient boosting.", "Analyzing code contributions to the CPython project using NetworkX and Matplotlib.\n \nI analyze cooperation on the CPython project by analyzing the code contributions that each participant on the project has done through time. I model these contributions as a succession of bipartite networks where the bipartite node sets are contributors and source code files; each contributor is linked to the source files to which they have contributed, weighted by the number of lines of source code added. Analyzing the structure of these networks using NetworkX and Matplotlib I found an hierarchy of nested groups of developers that corresponds to the developers that do most of the code contributions in the CPython project. This hierarchy, on the one hand, reflects the empirically well established fact that in FOSS projects only a small fraction of the developers account for most of the contributions. And, on the other hand, refutes the naive views of early academic accounts that characterized FOSS projects as a flat hierarchy of peers in which every individual does more or less the same. I argue that the structure of CPython's cooperation network can be characterized as an open elite, where the top levels of this hierarchy are filled with new individuals at a high pace. This feature is key for understanding the mechanisms and dynamics that make FOSS communities able to develop long term projects, with high individual turnover, and yet achieve high impact and coherent results as a result of large scale cooperation.\nYou can download the slides for this talk from https://github.com/jtorrents/thesis/blob/master/presentations/pydata_bcn/cpython_code_contributions.pdf\n \nIt's a well established fact that only a small fraction of developers account for most code contributions to FOSS projects.

Why straightforward implementations, even clever ones using advanced NumPy tricks, are inefficient.\nHow is Series.rolling().sum() implemented. How the same idea can be extended to higher dimensions with the help of the inclusion-exclusion principle to yield summed area tables.\nHow are Series.rolling().var() and friends implemented. The importance of numerically stable algorithms: why Welford's method is the better choice, even if it's a little slower.

The jupyter ecosystem is still under-utilized  for projects that require interactions from non-coder users, such as explorative dashboards or Business intelligence applications. There are other specialised options for these UI/UX interfaces, but integrating them into the analysis pipeline (e.g. Jupyter) is often rather hard. Preferably, we would be able to prototype these interactive applications without leaving our environment. \nJupyter-dashboards, ipywidgets, and other typical pydata libraries provide jupyter with the capabilities to create flexible, and rather powerful interactive elements. This toolset can be used in small projects to create the final facing interface for a limited number of end users. For bigger projects, a more robust UI/UX is normally required to support larger number of simultaneous users.

All proteins are composed by the combination of the same 20 amino acids, indeed, it is the 3D shape and detailed structure that differentiate a protein from another and so their functions. Determining protein structure is fundamental to understand their biological function; modify and alter their structures is the way in which drugs can block or activate a protein activity and doing so preventing or treating diseases. \nIn our lab we are understanding protein and DNA structures to the level of atomic resolution contributing to the biomedical research. We process with python the information of hundred thousands 3D coordinate structures already known and predict patterns that can be used to determine structure of unknown proteins. To achieve this objective, proteins are first reduced to a series of specific 3D vectors (Characteristic Vectors [1]) and then the geometrical relationships among them are extracted. We make use of biopython and python-igraph libraries to model each structure vectors in a network graph and we use supervised and unsupervised learning to classify and predict structure features. Python-igraph is a wrapper to a C code implementation of a set of graph algorithms of classical use in network analysis.\n[1] Sammito M1, Mill\u00e1n C, Rodr\u00edguez DD, de Ilarduya IM, Meindl K, De Marino I, Petrillo G, Buey RM, de Pereda JM, Zeth K, Sheldrick GM, Us\u00f3n I.

Epub 2013 Sep 15.\n \nIn all living systems any biological function is carried out by the interactions of proteins. The specific function of a protein is determined by its own 3d shape that can be modeled in a list of single atom coordinates derived from experimental analysis. In our lab we use python to process the information of hundred thousands structures already known to predict common patterns in protein folding.", "Blockchain and smart contracts explained (and simplified)\n \nSmart contracts are an old and simple concept. They are just computer programs that facilitate the negotiation and settlement of contracts by several parties. Their goal is to lower the transaction latency and cost associated with human middlemen. The blockchain technology brought the possibility to sanction contracts when peers do not trust each other, which is necessary for applications like virtual currencies. However, due to the CAP theorem and the cost of the Byzantine consensus, their performance tends to be quite bad.\nCurrent smart contract platforms such as Ethereum are general (one can issue any kind of contract), distributed (an updated copy is present at all the nodes within the same network), shared (an arbitrary amount of contracts are served within the same infrastructure) and secure (there is no way to tamper with the stored data). All those properties are undeniably good, but the consequence of keeping all those promises is that the infrastructure is exceedingly complex. Such an extense architecture does not add any functionality to a smart contract, it makes it trustworthy.\nIf one understands the raw concepts behind the Blockchain consensus, and we are willing to sacrifice some of the properties mentioned earlier, one can design and implement a simple ledger for smart contracts like pyledger (pyledger.readthedocs.io). Pyledger was designed as a platform for fast prototyping of smart contracts, and for experimentation, but in some particular cases can be good enough to be used in real-world cases.\nFinally... Fun time! All the concepts will be exemplified with a Q&A contest implemented as a smart contract where all attendants can play.\n \nBlockchain is the next big thing that will revolutionize everything, but no one knows how. The same can be said about smart contracts.  Bitcoin and Ethereum are great technologies, but too complex for most cases. This talk will explain why smart contracts are hard, and why they don't need to be. Finally, a simple ledger for smart contracts in python (pyledger) will be presented.", "Python for visualization of HPC applications\n \nThis work describes the usage of python in application that makes use of high performance application (HPC). \nSuch applications comprise examples as computational fluid dynamics, where the analysis of large data bases \nis necessary in order to extract useful information.

If a cell was a factory, proteins would be the workers, performing very specific tasks in a production chain, in which a failure at any of the steps might affect the others. In order to really understand the function of proteins, there are a number of biochemical techniques that we can apply, but to get a really accurate description of their mechanisms we need to have information up to their atomic level. Proteins are composed by different combinations of 20 amino acids which form chains and result in an intricate and functional structure. We know the final shape of the protein is dependent from its sequence but we can't (currently) predict the outcome of a given sequence, so we need experimental techniques to obtain this information. We can't directly look a protein with a microscope and see its three-dimensional atomic arrangement. There are biophysical techniques that allow us to get low-resolution shapes or surfaces of them, but the only current method that provides atomic detail is x-ray diffraction. In contrast to microscopy, were after illuminating your sample you can, with the appropriate lenses, transform back your reflected rays in an image, in x-ray diffraction we only get the Fourier transform of our protein's structure, that is, its diffraction pattern, but we lose the phase information from the diffracted rays. This problem, known as the phase problem, is an issue in structure solution, because, compared to the intensities of the diffraction pattern, phases provide much more information about our protein's structure. Phases can be computed from a coordinates model, so, if there is a structure of a protein that is expected to be similar (in terms of their coordinates) to an unknown one, it can be used to provide initial estimates of the phases and then improve them until the problem structure is solved.\nProteins do not adopt random shapes. There are forces that act on them and, according to the chemical properties of the amino acids and the context they have around, they will arrange in particular forms. The first level of structure formed is what we call secondary structure, which is formed of alpha helices and beta strands. These are very general and are present in all kind of proteins. As letters in different books, which are general if looked at independently but can acquire a quite different meaning in 'El Quijote' than in '50 Shades of Grey', these structure fragments alone have a different meaning than when set in a context with other structure elements. Yet, even combinations of a few elements can still be general and frequent, and have a sense, such as the phrase 'Once upon a time' in so many tales. In the protein case,  particular small combinations of alpha helices and beta strands should also appear more frequently and can be studied on their different contexts. In a way, we could say that, protein structures, from a top down view, look quite different between them, but from a bottom up one, when we go to small pieces, they look much more similar.\nIn our group, we try to exploit these properties of protein structures for solving two types of problems. One is a search problem, consisting in understanding which is the best way in which to break down a larger model of a protein similar to an unknown one in order to refine it and get the correct phases and solve the structure. The other one is more of a prediction problem, in which we want to find structural units in the database of solved structures in order to help us interpret them and extract new information from this vast amount of data. In order to solve both problems we need a numerical description of our system than can help us describing its geometrical features in an accurate way. We have developed a description of such secondary structure fragments based on what we call characteristic vectors, that we also employ to represent the relations between such elements. This description can be implemented in a network graph that allows to use community clustering algorithms on it in order to evaluate simultaneously all the relations between the elements of the structure and find its communities.\nFrom the technical point of view, the language we use for our development is Python, and the tool in which our graphs are implemented is python-igraph. There are a number of community clustering algorithms available and deciding which is the best for our case and which metrics to use to describe our structures has been an interesting process that we want to share with you. In this talk I will explain our research and development on this topic and I will link the general descriptions to our current and successful use case, possibly leaving open questions on what can we do more!\n \nHow can you best exploit the information on the protein structures that we already know in order to solve the (many more) that we don\u2019t know? That\u2019s the question we try to solve in our group and this talk will show our use of community clustering on the use case of aiding protein structure solution.", "Marketing Data Science\n \nDigital Marketing is changing the way corporations and brands communicates with customers.

This tutorial shows how an open source framework using several open source technologies could potentially solve the problem.\nMy journey started with this[1] question on StackOverflow. I wanted to be able to do my usual data science stuff, mostly in python, and then deploy them somewhere serving like a REST API, responding to requests in real-time, using the output of the trained models. My original line of thought was this workflow:\n\ntrain the model in python or pyspark or in scala in apache spark.\nget the model, put it in an apache flink stream and serve.\n\nThis was the point at which I had been reading and watching tutorials and attending meetups related to these technologies. I was looking for a solution which is better than:\n\ntrain models in python\nwrite a web-service using flask, put it behind a apache2 server, and put a bunch of them behind a load balancer.\n\nThis just sounded wrong, or at its best, not scalable. After a bit of research, I came across PipelineIO[2,3] which seems to promise exactly what I'm looking for. In this tutorial we use PipelineIO, to deply a cluster on the cloud, which gives us a JupyterHub to develop our method, and uses PMML to persist and deploy and serve the model.

However, the difficulty of annotating data is often underestimated. Gathering a sufficiently large collection of good-quality labelled data requires careful problem definition and multiple iterations. In this talk, I will describe three case studies and lessons learnt from them. Each case shows several aspect of the process that should be considered in advance to ensure the project is successful. \nCase study 1: word embeddings\nMethods for representing words as vectors have become popular in recent years. Historically, these have been evaluated by correlating the \"similarity\" of word pairs, as predicted by a model, to that provided by a human judge. A typical data set consists of word pairs and a similarity score, e.g. cat - dog = 80% and cat - democracy = 21%. \nQuestions:\n\nIs the task clearly defined? \n\nWhat exactly is word similarity? We all have an intuitive understanding, but a lot of corner cases exist, e.g. What rice - cooking and big - small? Each annotator may interpret your instructions differently. Can you guarantee they have not misunderstood the task?\n\nIs the task easy to do?\n\nBecause it is so hard to provide annotators with exact instructions, they will often disagree. The similarity of tiger\u2013cat ranges from 50% to 90% in a popular data set.  If human cannot agree what the right answer for a given input is, how can a model ever do well?\n\nDo you have quality control in place?\n\nHow should one deal with poor-quality annotation? Do you have a mechanism for identifying annotator errors or consistently under-performing annotators? \n\nHow much data can you get?\n\nCan you get enough data? How much do you need? What if you have to data by unreliable annotators?\nCase study 2: symptom recognition in medical data\nThe task is to identify mentions of symptoms in notes taken by a doctor during routine exams, e.g. **Abdominal pain**. Causes may include **acute bacterial tonsilitis**. No allergies.\n\nDo you need an expert (linguist/doctor/banker)?\n\nCan you find subject experts? Can you communicate to them exactly what the task is, keeping in mind they will not be NLP experts?\n\nPeople issues\n\nWhat if annotators do not show up, or take two-week breaks between sessions?\n\nCan you measure inter-annotator agreement?\n\nCan you quantify annotator agreement? In the case of word similarity, this is reasonably easy. This gets trickier when the annotation unit has complex structure (e.g. it is a phrase). See submission by Alexandar Savkov for more details.\n\nDo you have a process for resolving conflicts?\n\nIf two of the annotators disagree, can the conflict be resolve or should the data be discarded?\nCase study 3: boilerplate removal in HTML pages\n\nWhat is the data for?\n\nThe distinction between content and boilerplate is blurry and may change depending on what you plan to do next.\n\nTooling\n\nDo you need specialist software? Do you have to write it yourself?\n \nThe first stage in a data science project is often to collect training data. However, getting a good data set is surprisingly tricky and takes longer than one expects. This talk describes our experiences in labelling gold-standard data and the lessons we learnt the hard way. We will present three case studies from natural language processing and discuss the challenges we encountered.", "Data Science & Data Visualization in Python.

While remarkably effective, RNNs are painfully slow due their sequential nature. Convolutions allow us to process a whole sequence in parallel greatly reducing the time required to train and infer. One of the most important advances in convolutional architectures has been the use of gating to concur the vanishing gradient problem thus allowing arbitrarily deep networks to be trained efficiently. \nIn this talk we'll review the key innovations in the  DenseNet architecture and show how to adapt it to text. We'll go over \"deconvolution\" operators and dilated convolutions as means of handling long range dependencies. Finally we'll look at convolutions applied to [translation] (https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.10099)  at the character level. \nThe goal of this talk is to demonstrate the practical advantages and relative ease with which these methods can be applied, as such we will focus on the ideas and implementations (in tensorflow) more than on the math.\n \nThose folks in computer vision keep publishing amazing ideas about you to apply convolutions to images.

Unsupersived models on the other hand typically try to fit a predefined distribution to be consistent with the statistics of some large unlabelled data set or maximise the vector similarity of words that appear in similar contexts. Evaluating the trained model often starts by \"eye-balling\" the results, i.e. checking that your own expectations of similarity are fulfilled by the model.\nDocuments that talk about football should be in the same category and \"cat\" is more similar with \"dog\" than with \"pen\". Is \"cat\" more similar to \"tiger\" than to \"dog\"? Ideally this information should be captured in a single metric that can be maximised. Tools such as pyLDAvis and gensim provide many different ways to get an overview of the learned model or a single metric that can be maximised: topic coherence, perplexity, ontological similarity, term co-occurrence, word analogy. Using these methods without a good understanding of what the metric represents can give misleading results. The unsupervised models are also often used as part of larger processing pipelines, it is not clear if these intrinsic evaluation measures are approriate in such cases, perhaps the models should instead be evaluated against an external metric like accuracy for the entire pipeline.\nIn this talk I will give an intuition of what the evaluation metrics are trying to achieve, give some recommendations for when to use them, what kind of pitfalls one should be aware of when using topic models and the inherent difficulty of measuring or even defining semantic similarity concisely.\nI assume that you are familiar with topic models, I will not cover how they are defined or trained. I talk specifically about the tools that are available for evaluating a topic model, irrespective of which algorithm you've used to learn one. The talk is accompanied by a notebook at github.com/mattilyra/pydataberlin-2017\n \nUnsupervised models in natural language processing (NLP) have become very popular recently. Word2vec, GloVe and LDA provide powerful computational tools to deal with natural language and make exploring large document collections feasible. We would like to be able to say if a model is objectively good or bad, and compare different models to each other, this is often tricky to do in practice.", "\u201cWhich car fits my life?\u201d  - mobile.de\u2019s approach to recommendations\n \nAt  mobile.de, Germany\u2019s biggest car marketplace, a dedicated team of data engineers and scientists, supported by the IT project house inovex is responsible for creating intelligent data products. Driven by our company slogan \u201cFind the car that fits your life\u201d, we focus on personalised recommendations to address several user needs. Thereby we improve customer experience during browsing as well as finding the perfect offering.\nIn an introduction to recommendation systems, we briefly mention the traditional approaches for recommendation engines, thereby motivating the need for sophisticated approaches. In particular, we explain the different concepts including collaborative and content-based filtering as well as hybrid approaches and general matrix factorisation methods. This is followed by a deep dive into the implementation and architecture at mobile.de that comprises ElasticSearch, Cassandra and Mahout. We explain how Python and Java is used simultaneously  to create and serve recommendations. \nBy presenting our car-model recommender that suggests similar car models of different brands as a concrete use-case, we reiterate on key-aspects during modelling and implementation. \nIn particular, we present a matrix factorisation library that we used and share our experiences with it. We conclude by a brief demonstration of our results and discuss the improvements we achieved in terms of key performance indicators. Furthermore, we use our use case to exemplify the usage of deep learning for recommendations, comparing it with other traditional approaches and hence providing a brief account of the future of recommendation engines.\n \nAs Germany\u2019s largest online vehicle marketplace mobile.de uses recommendations at scale to help users find the perfect car. We elaborate on collaborative & content-based filtering as well as a hybrid approach addressing the problem of a fast-changing inventory. We then dive into the technical implementation of the recommendation engine, outlining the various challenges faced and experiences made.", "Patterns for Collaboration between Data Scientists And Software Engineers\n \nCollaboration between data scientists and software engineers can have the following issues:\n\u2022 Different tools used between data scientists and engineers (more interactive vs more automated, for example ipython notebook vs command line)\n\u2022 If getting the latest data requires ops/engineering knowledge then the analysis may be done in \"stale\" data or a too-small subset of the data (As an example: data scientists working with manual exports ) \n\u2022 Regression testing/parameter tuning/evaluation of results/backfills and other common scenarios in data-driven applications also require more engineering knowledge. The engineers are in the best position to provide tools and processes for the data science team, but it can happen that this potential goes untapped\nThose issues lead to more time to production, unhappiness in the data science team if they end up fighting with operations work instead of doing mostly the work they like,  less trustworthy results and less trust between teams in general. If collaboration is done right however,  data science and engineering teams can have a very good symbiotic relationship where each person takes advantage of their strengths towards a common goal.\nSome collaboration patterns to foster a good relationship between data scientists and engineers are the following:\n\u2022 Continuous evaluation \u2013 making sure the data science algorithm\ncontinues to give good results with every commit (or combinations of\ncommits, in case there is several repositories with different data\nscientists working on them)\n\u2022 Report templating \u2013 data scientists can work with jupyter\nnotebooks with an extension  that allows those ipynb\nfiles to be used as templates (ie, where some variable values can be filled in later). Those notebooks can then be applied to\ndifferent datasets to quickly diagnose issues.\n\u2022 Data API \u2013 have a well documented API for the data scientists to\nhave easy access to the data so that they can do their exploration\nwithout needing the software engineering team to manually provide\nexports\n\u2022 Some flexibility regarding tools \u2013 if domain experts prefer to use\nSFTP to upload files to the server for analysis, let them. Too much flexibility can be an anti-pattern.\n \nThe talk is going to present, with examples, how  a software engineer team can work\ntogether with data scientists (both in-house and external collaborators) in\norder to leverage their unique domain knowledge and skills in analyzing\ndata, while supporting them to work independently and making sure that their work can be  constantly tested/evaluated and easily integrated into the larger product.", "Developments in Test-Driven Data Analysis\n \nTest-driven data analysis fuses and builds upon the ideas of test-driven development and reproducible research to support higher quality data analysis.\nFoundational concepts are: * Level 0: Reference Tests * Level 1: Automatic constraint discovery and validation.\nThis talk will extend these to cover tight constraints on string fields with\n  * automatically discovered regular expressions with rexpy\n  * constraints between datasets\nand probably more.\nBackground material:\n\nPyCon UK Talk, Cardiff, Test-Driven Data Analysis https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIw_7aUuY50\nBlog: https://tdda.info, especially posts https://www.tdda.info/the-new-referencetest-class-for-tdda and https://www.tdda.info/constraint-discovery-and-verification-for-pandas-dataframes\nOverview: https://www.predictiveanalyticsworld.com/patimes/four-ways-data-science-goes-wrong-and-how-test-driven-data-analysis-can-help/\nIn terms of some of the new material that will be covered in this talk, see\nhttps://www.tdda.info/introducing-rexpy-automatic-discovery-of-regular-expressions\nhttps://rexpy.herokuapp.com\n\n \nTest-driven data analysis fuses and builds upon the ideas of test-driven development and reproducible research to support higher quality data analysis.

Many implementations of the basic Collaborative Filtering algorithms are available, however, recent advances in the field are often less documented and known.\nIn order to provide a comparative analysis of available libraries and define minimal requirements for a performance comparison of Recommender System algorithms, the talk will be structured in two parts. \nIn the first part, the speaker will introduce the last years of relevant literature in the field of Recommender System, giving an overview on advanced tensor approaches, such as those used for Context- and Time-aware Recommender Systems. \nIn the second part of the talk, existing Python Collaborative Filtering libraries are reviewed.\nAmong others, the following important criteria will be considered: availability of state of the art and benchmark algorithms, parallel computation, maintenance, and easiness of use.\n \nRecommender Systems are nowadays ubiquitous in our lives. Although many implementations of basic algorithms are well known, recent advances in the field are often less documented. \nThis talks aims at reviewing available Recommender Systems libraries in Python, including cutting edge Time- and Context-aware state of the art models.", "Introduction to Search\n \nSearch engines make archives, inventories, websites, large publishing platforms, and the internet navigable. In this talk, I will introduce the basic building blocks of a search engine.\nWordPress.com is a platform where anyone can create a blog or website, and read posts that are published there and elsewhere. More than 90 million posts and pages are published on WordPress.com per month. To make it easier for our users to find the ones they are most interested in, we built a search engine that is based on Elasticsearch.\nIn order to keep improving our search algorithm, we need to track and analyze our user\u2019s interactions with the search results. I will present an overview of the metrics we and others use to evaluate the performance of search algorithms.\n \nSearch engines make archives, inventories, websites, large publishing platforms, and the internet navigable. Using the search engine we built at WordPress.com, a platform where more than 90 million blog posts and web pages are published per month, as an example, I will explain how search engines work and how their performance can be evaluated.", "Size Matters! A/B Testing When Not Knowing Your Number of Trials\n \nGetYourGuide is the leading online platform for touristic in-destination activities such as tours, excursions, and pub crawls. An important marketing channel for us is search engine marketing (SEM). The question of how much to pay for showing a potential customer a paid ad is highly complex. It does not only involve some estimate about the likelihood that the user will follow our ad to our website and finally book with us; the price is also influenced by our competitors since the decision about what ad is shown is made in an auction. A lot of room for improving our bidding strategies.\nIn early 2016, Google Adwords, one of the big players in SEM, rolled out a new feature called Campaign drafts and experiments. It enabled advertisers for the first time to test different bidding strategies in proper A/B tests. We thought they were proper, at least, until we figured out that Adwords wouldn't supply us with all necessary information to evaluate our tests in a decent statistical way.\nThe simple question of statistical significance became a search for the right question to ask.\nIn this talk, we will explain the problem in some more detail and report about our various approaches of how to circumvent it. On our journey, we will touch the foundations of SEM, A/B testing as well as time series.\n \nIf an A/B test's statistical evaluation is based on the number of trials and successes for each variation, what happens if you don't know the number of trials for your experiment? Although this question sounds rather theoretical, we faced it in practice. This talk is about our search for the right question to ask.", "Best Practices for Debugging\n \nDebugging is a daily activity of any programmer. Frequently, it is assumed that programmers can debug. However, programmers often have to deal with existing code that simply does not work. This tutorial attempts to change that by introducing concepts for debugging and corresponding programming techniques.\nIn this tutorial, participants will learn strategies for systematically debugging Python programs. We will work through a series of examples, each with a different kind of bug and with increasing difficulty. The training will be interactive, combining one-person and group activities, to improve your debugging skills in an entertaining way.\nContents:\n\nSyntax Error against Runtime exceptions\nDebugging with the scientific method\nInspection of variables with print and introspection functions\nUsing an interactive debugger\nLogging\nCode Review\n\n \nThis tutorial introduces concepts and techniques for systematic debugging. Participants will debug example programs with different kinds of bugs and with increasing difficulty.", "Deep Learning for detection on a phone: how to stay sane and build a pipeline you can trust\n \nDeep Learning has gone through the hype phase where it seemed like a skeleton key, followed by a phase of despair for many who found the building blocks to be too esoteric and the training code and process too unreliable. Deploying on a device with strong hardware limitations adds that extra spice to the mix.\nThis talk addresses a very specific use case: preparing a Deep Neural Network to be used for detection in real time in a mobile phone app. It is meant for hands-on engineers and data scientists who live in that area where writing scalable and testable code is every bit as important (and troublesome!) as understanding your loss function.\nWe will cover different steps of the process, such as:\n Defining a good model for you:\n  * Your device: it is what it is.\n  * Cargo cult or what is this layer doing and do we need it?\n Gathering the right training data: who, where and how will be using your app?\n Training:\n  * Transfer learning as a small company's best friend.\n  * Integrating different sources in your data pipeline.\n Evaluating earlier rather than later.\nDepending on time and interest, we may also go over data augmentation and/or model persistence.\n \nDeploying a deep model on a mobile device to be used for real-time detection is not quite trivial yet. Defining your Deep Learning architecture, gathering the right data, designing your training process, evaluating your models and turning this into a pipeline that keeps everyone on the team (somewhat) sane - these all have their pitfalls.", "Building smart IoT applications with Python and Spark\n \nThe Internet of Things and Industry 4.0 are here, bringing along a vast amount of connected devices and sensors producing even more data.\nIn order to build smart applications on top of IoT sensor data we need to deal with the challenges that come along time-series data from a large amount of devices.\nAt WATTx we build data application prototypes in the field of smart homes, smart buildings, and smart climate, which involves making use of data coming from many IoT sensors measuring -- amongst others -- temperature, humidity, motion, and luminance.\nThe purpose of this talk is to present how we use Python and Spark to effectively analyse and model IoT data. In particular I will introduce how we use Python to process and model data from multiple IoT sensors, build machine learning models on top of it, and use Spark to scale and deploy our models in automated data pipelines in the cloud as smart IoT applications.\nI will use the development of predictive models for smart building applications as a real-world example to demonstrate this setup.\nI hope that this talk will give valuable insights on how Python and PySpark in conjunction with AWS are powerful tools to work with time-series sensor data from the Internet of Things and build data products on top of it.\n \nIn this talk I will present how we use Python, PySpark and AWS as our preferred data science stack for the Internet of Things, which allows us to efficiently develop and deploy smart data applications on top of IoT sensor data.

This dataset consists of question pairs which are either duplicate or not. Duplicate questions mean the same thing.\nFor example, the question pairs below are duplicates (from the Quora dataset)\nHow does Quora quickly mark questions as needing improvement? Why does Quora mark my questions as needing improvement/clarification before I have time to give it details? Literally within seconds\u2026\nWhy did Trump win the Presidency?

Is the depiction of hacker societies realistic? What mistakes are made when depicting hacking in \"\"Mr. Robot\"\" compared to real-life cybersecurity breaches or just a regular use of technologies?\nHow can I start an online shopping (e-commerce) website? Which web technology is best suitable for building a big E-Commerce website?\nIn this talk, we discuss methods which can be used to detect duplicate questions using Quora dataset. Of course, these methods can be used for other similar datasets.\nMethods discussed in this talk range from simple TF-IDF, Singular Value Decomposition, Fuzzy Features, Word2Vec features, GloVe features, LSTMs and 1D CNN. We provide a comparison of performance of these algorithms on the Quora dataset.\nUsing very simple methods and then using deep learning methods in python we achieved an accuracy similar to current state of the art on a normal machine with only one GPU.\n \nQuora released its first ever dataset publicly on 24th Jan, 2017.

When using complex techniques like deep learning on very large datasets, it is not easy to prove that our algorithms behave they way we intend them to and e.g. do not discriminate against certain groups of people.\nIn my talk, I will discuss why ensuring transparency and fairness in machine learning is not easy, and how we can use Python tools to investigate our machine learning systems and makre sure they behave they way they should.\n\nIntroduction: Why you should care about this (->EU-Data Protection Directive)\nWhat kind of problems can occur in machine learning systems (bias in the input data, leakage of sensitive information into the training data, hidden usage of protected attributes by the algorithm)?\nHow can we measure and correct for bias in our systems (certifying and removing disparate impact)?\nHow can we understand the decisions that our algorithms make (perturbation analysis, simplified modeling, blackbox testing)?\nHow can we design our machine learning systems to make sure they're compliant and accountable (anonymization of data, monitoring of outcomes, auditing of algorithms)?\nOutlook: The future of transparency and accountability in machine learning\n\n \nThis talk will try to answer a simple question: When building machine learning systems, how can we make sure that they treat people fairly and can be held accountable? While seemingly trivial, this question is not easy to answer, especially when using complex methods like deep learning.

This has caused some hilarious conversations with recruiters on linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/vincentwarmerdam/ but it also made me wonder. Can I create a service that generates strings that sound like potential pokemon names and what might be the simplest possible way to make that into a service? Also, would it be possible to generate pokemon names that start with three random characters and end with 'base' (KREBASE, MONBASE would be appropriate but IEYBASE would not be). \nTurns out that this is an interesting problem from a ML standpoint and that it is rediculously easy to build in the cloud.

I am submitting multiple talks that I think are interesting and relevant to the PyData crowd, I'll gladly leave it to the committee which (or if any) of them are relevant to the local community.\n \nIn this talk I will explain how I built a service that generates Pokemon names. You'd be surprised how hard it is to do this properly and how easy it is to do it practically.", "Semi-Supervised Bootstrapping of Relationship Extractors with Distributional Semantics\n \nRelationship Extraction (RE) transforms unstructured text into relational triples, each representing a relationship between two named-entities. This relationships can then be used to populate knowledge bases, or build knowledge graphs, which can support several tasks, such as Question Answering.\nA bootstrapping system for RE starts with a collection of documents and a few seed instances.  The system scans the document collection, collecting occurrence contexts for the seed instances. Then, based on these contexts, the system generates extraction patterns. The documents are scanned again using the patterns to match new relationship instances. These newly extracted instances are then added to the seed set, and the process is repeated until a certain stop criteria is met.\nBootstrapping approaches relying on TF-IDF weighted vectors have limitations when trying to find similar instances, since the similarity between any two relationship instance vectors is only positive when the instances share at least one term. For instance, the phrases was \"founded by\" and is the \"co-founder of\" do not have any common words, but they have the same semantics.  Stemming techniques can aid in these cases, but only for variations of the same root word. By relying on word embeddings, the similarity of two phrases can be captured even if no common words exist. For instance, the word embeddings for \"co-founder\", \"founded\" and \"creator\" should be similar, since these words tend to occur in the same contexts.\nI propose to present a system which extracts relationship instances by bootstrapping and by relying on word embeddings. It was evaluated against a popular system which relies on TF-IDF weighted vectors, the paper describing the system was presented at EMNLP'15 and won an honorable mention for best short-paper award.\n \nSemi-supervised bootstrapping techniques for relationship extraction from text iteratively expand a set of initial seed relationships while limiting the semantic drift. This talk presents an approach to bootstrap relationship instances using word embeddings to find similar relationships. Results show that relying on word embeddings achieves a better performance than using TF-IDF weighted vectors.", "Biases are bugs: algorithm fairness and machine learning ethics\n \nAlgorithms can make decisions, and these decisions can have an impact on people's lives. By feeding data into these algorithms, they can reproduce or amplify our societal biases and take unfair decisions.\nBiases are bugs. They need to be found, fixed, and learnt from. A mix of good ethics and good engineering practices can get us a long way towards that goal.\nIn this talk, you will learn what biases are, see examples of algorithms gone wrong, and explore some software tools you can use and engineering practices you can adopt in your own work to make your algorithms more fair.\n \nBiases are bugs.

Known as Polynomial Chaos, this technique is largely unknown outside of some engineering fields. Nevertheless, the method allows us to model arbitrary distributions (with finite second moment) using distributions that are more familiar, e.g. the uniform or normal distributions. The polynomial chaos technique shifts the burden of understanding random variables to one of understanding deterministic series coefficients.\nThis method is particularly good for understanding dynamical systems with parametric uncertainty. The Polynomial Chaos expansion allows us to generate Monte Carlo simulations with far fewer simulation runs. In addition, we can use the method to quantify uncertainty in observations even when faced with small sample sizes. This talk will demonstrate the derivation of the technique and include some Python examples of ways it can be used to model systems and understand data in the presence of uncertainty. This will be a highly technical talk, touching on elements of measure-theoretic probability and functional analysis.\n \nParametric uncertainty is broadly difficult to quantify. In particular, when those parameters don't fit nice distributions it can be hard to generate reasonable simulations. Polynomial chaos is a somewhat obscure technique that leverages a natural connection between probability distributions and orthogonal polynomial families.

The GDPR provides for strong sanctions, with fines up to 20M Euro, or 4% of the yearly global turnover (whichever is higher) for companies in breach. It applies to any EU company, and any company processing the data of EU residents. It also broadens \"personal data\" to include anything generated by people behavior or referring to an identified person. Pseudonymised data will remain personal data under the GDPR.  \nThe GDPR turns data privacy from a simple legal problem to a core business issue about data collection, management, processing, and analysis. Doing any kind of data analytics, especially in B2C contexts, will become challenging. For example, marketing analytics based on people tracking may become technically difficult and methodologically almost unfeasible. Automated scoring and decision-making will become strongly regulated. Simply collecting \"big data\", figuring out later what to do with it will be a thing of the past - many companies will, therefore have to radically change their way of working with data: either delete a lot of their data or genuinely anonymize it. Once data is anonymized, it is no longer subject to the GDPR, but achieving high-utility anonymization is a difficult task. \nPrivacy by design and by default will become a pre-requisite for compliant personal data analytics. There has been a lot of progress over the last decade on data privacy and anonymization techniques. It is now possible to build recommender systems, classification models and almost everything imaginable with anonymized data, but maintaining data utility requires careful planning and optimization. This is especially tough for web/mobile/IoT data streams: high-dimensional data from multiple sources with spatial and temporal attributes. Most use cases are doable in compliant ways - state-of-the-art solutions will be reviewed.\n \nThey upcoming privacy legislation of the EU will radically change the way we do data analytics, restricting the processing of personally identifiable data. We will go through common data processing scenarios and learn how the new legislation will affect them, offering practical solutions.", "Fast Multidimensional Signal Processing using Julia with Shearlab.jl\n \nThe Shearlet Transform was proposed by the Professor Gitta Kutyniok (https://www.tu-berlin.de/?108957) and her colleagues as a multidimensional generalization of the Wavelet Transform, and since then it has been adopted by a lot of Companies and Institutes by its stable and optimal representation of multidimensional signals. Shearlab.jl is a already registered Julia package (https://github.com/arsenal9971/Shearlab.jl) based in the most used implementation of Shearlet Transform programmed in Matlab by the Research Group of Prof. Kutyniok (https://www.shearlab.org/software), it was developed as a project apart of my PhD studies but ended up being the main computational tool of them, used mainly to reconstruct the Light Field of a 3D Scene from Sparse Photographic Samples of Different Perspectives with Stereo Vision purposes.\nWhy I think this will be an interesting thing to present at JuliaCon 2017?\n\n\nA lot of research institutes and companies have already adopted the Shearlet Transform in their work (e.g. Fraunhofer Institute in Berlin and Charit\u00e9 Hospital in Berlin, Mathematical Institute of TU Berlin) by its directional sensitivity, reconstruction stability and sparse representation; with applications that goes from MRI Imaging in Hospitals to Video Compression Decoding. \n\n\nI am convinced Shearlab.jl is the best implementation so far of Shearlet Transform, basing my arguments on the benchmarks already runned against the last Matlab version which is the most used at the moment (here benchmarks https://github.com/arsenal9971/Shearlab.jl/blob/master/benchmarks/README.md) beating it by at least double the speed on different experiments. \n\n\nNot everything is about performance and technical mathematics, so I also have cool usage examples to show with some algorithms that have been implemented lately, like: Image Decomposition and Recovery (https://github.com/arsenal9971/Shearlab.jl/blob/master/examples/Shearlets/Examples%20of%20Image%20Decoding%20and%20Recovery.ipynb), Image Denosing (https://github.com/arsenal9971/Shearlab.jl/blob/master/examples/Shearlets/Image%20Denoising.ipynb) Image Inpainting (the coolest so far) (https://github.com/arsenal9971/Shearlab.jl/blob/master/examples/Shearlets/Image%20Inpainting.ipynb) which I am using at the moment for the Light Field Recovery of a sparsely sampled 3D scene. - The Package was also already presented in the Berlin Julia Users MeetUp with a very good response and interest from the community (https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/Julia-Users-Group/events/236791753/).\n\n\n \nShearlab is a Julia Library with toolbox for two- and threedimensional data processing using the Shearlet system as basis functions which generates a sparse representation of cartoon-like functions with applications on Signal Processing, Compressed Sensing, 3D Imaging, MRI Imaging and a lot more, with visible improvements with respect of the Wavelet Transform in representing multidimensional data.", "What does it all mean? - Compositional distributional semantics for modelling natural language\n \nRepresenting words as vectors in a high-dimensional space has a long history in natural language processing. Recently, neural network based approaches such as word2vec and GloVe have gained a substantial amount of popularity and have become an ubiquituous part in many NLP pipelines for a variety tasks, ranging from sentiment analysis and text classification, to machine translation, recognising textual entailment or parsing.\nAn important research problem is how to best leverage these word representations to form longer units of text such as phrases and full sentences. Proposals range from simple pointwise vector operations, to approaches inspired by formal semantics, deep learning based approaches that learn composition as part of an end-to-end system, and more structured approaches such as anchored packed dependency trees.\nIn this talk I will introduce a variety of compositional distributional models and outline different approaches of how effective meaning representations beyond the word level can successfully be built. I will furthermore provide an overview of the advantages of using compositional distributional approaches, as well as their limitations. Lastly, I will discuss their merit for applications such as aspect oriented sentiment analysis and question answering.\n \nDistributional semantic word representations have become an integral part in numerous natural language processing pipelines in academia and industry.

Understanding Networks makes for a very strong foundation on what everything else is built upon. \nIn this talk I will cover the basics of :\n\nAn IP Packet data analysis: the basic and most fundamental thing everything on a network builds upon. A packet can carry a lot of information and interesting details about behavioural habits of a user or even attributes of a device. Understanding the nature of the IP packet data leads to a larger understanding of Networks when analysed on a scale. And like the data rule of thumb the more data over a period of time you\u2019re able to learn from the better, and more accurate your intelligence become.\nEvaluating your local network using visualisation tools like IPython Notebook and Bokeh. \nGathering insights from the data to answer questions like How much data on an average do I generate on a daily basis?

How can I automate the process of analysing my network data and much more.\n\n \nIn this talk I would show how I used open source tools like Moloch, Wireshark, Bokeh and Jupyter to analyse my home network data for the day. Not just the volume of data generated daily,  but how interesting it is to leverage data tools to discover when your network is experiencing downtime which could be as a result of packet loss, poorly placed Access points or just proximity away from your rout", "Analysing user comments on news articels with Doc2Vec and Machine Learning classification\n \nDoc2Vec is a nice neural network framework for text analysis.  The machine learning technique computes so called document and word embeddings, i.e. vector representations of documents and words. These representations can be used to uncover semantic relations.  For instance, Doc2Vec may learn that the word \"King\" is similar to \"Queen\" but less so to \"Database\".\nI used the Doc2Vec framework to analyze user comments on German online news articles and uncovered some interesting relations among the data. Furthermore, I fed the resulting Doc2Vec document embeddings as inputs to a supervised machine learning classifier. Accordingly, given a particular comment, can we determine from which news site it originated?  Are there patterns among user comments? Can we identify stereotypical comments for different news sites?\nBesides presenting the results of my experiments, I will give a short introduction to Doc2Vec.\n \nI used the Doc2Vec framework to analyze user comments on German online news articles and uncovered some interesting relations among the data.

The current stage of data availability depends largely on the the German states. In 2017, Open Data will regain importance and attention as the German Open Data Law has been passed in the German parliament in spring. Recently, Germany has also joint the Open Government Partnership. As many Open Data activists have been demanding better access to data in the past, how satisfactory are those changes on the government side? Those changes will be briefly discussed regarding their mean for our society and for those who have made use of Open Data already. \nIn the second part, I will explain how Open Data can be quite awesome already and what obstacles we have been dealing with in the past by showing 3 different, exciting and very active projects: Measuring air quality (Luftdaten), making election data more accessible (Wahlsalons) and collaboratively collecting and sharing data in a huge database (Wikidata). Open Data does not only need coders. It needs those that lobby for it, those that manage the projects, those that spread the word and most importantly: those who use the applications built upon Open Data. Will it be you, too?\n \nThe talk will give an overview about  the current state of Open Data in Germany including recent legislative changes that might lead to more Open Data. Leaving behind the basics, the talk will show the implications to the existing Open Data community. Three very different examples of current projects from the Code for Germany community will be presented showing you the bright side of Open Data.", "Find the text similiarity you need with the next generation of word embeddings in Gensim\n \nThere are many ways to find similar words/docs with  an open-source Natural Language processing library Gensim that I maintain.  I will give an overview of modern word embeddings like Google's Word2vec, Facebook's FastText, GloVe, WordRank, VarEmbed and discuss what business tasks fit them best.\nWhat is the most similar word to \"king\"? It depends on what you mean by similar. \"King\" can be interchanged with \"Canute\", but it's attribute is \"crown\". We will discuss how to achieve these two kinds of similarity from word embeddings.\n \nWhat is the closest word to \"king\"? Is it \"Canute\" or is it \"crowned\"? There are many ways to define \"similar words\" and \"similar texts\". Depending on your definition you should choose a word embedding to use.

With the advent of big data, new approaches and technologies are needed to tackle the increase in volume, variety, and velocity of data. This talk illustrates how analysts, journalists, and scientists can benefit from exploratory data analysis and data science. \nImagine a journalist who wants to cross-reference the names on the guest list of a parliament with online information about lobbyists to identify which party meets which company. A business analyst might want to quantify what topics certain customers are discussing on Twitter or how their sentiment towards a particular product is. \nExploratory data analysis and data science techniques enable researchers, journalists and businesses to ask bigger and more ambitious questions than anybody before them and to leverage the abundance of information that is available today. \nThe Digital Humanities are located at the intersection of computing and the disciplines of the humanities. They can benefit from the massive-scale automated analysis of content like images and text. Researchers, analysts, and journalists can quantify the state of society from publicly available data like tweets. It is now possible to construct an almost complete map of our civilization just by looking at the tags and GPS coordinates of Flickr photos.\nA vast Python ecosystem is supporting this including machine learning frameworks like scikit-learn, dedicated deep learning frameworks like Keras, and topic modeling tools like gensim. All these tools are open source and can be integrated into powerful data science pipelines. Rather than training neural networks from scratch, pretrained features for text and images can be adapted for fast results.\n \nAnalyzing millions of images and enormous text sources using machine learning and deep learning techniques is simple and straightforward in the Python ecosystem. Powerful machine learning algorithms and interactive visualization frameworks make it easy to conduct and communicate large scale experiments. Exploring this data can yield new insights for researchers, journalists, and businesses.", "Large Scale Vandalism Detection in Knowledge Bases\n \nKnowledge bases are an important source of information for many AI system: they rely on the bases for enriching the information they process to make better user experience. Obtaining such Knowledge Bases is difficult, and which is why this process is crowd-sourced. One of such bases is Wikidata: they allow everybody on the Internet to edit the content and add new information.\nUnfortunately, Wikidata is often targeted by vandals, who misuse the system and put false or offensive information there. This may lead to incorrect behaviour of the AI systems. To keep the base clean, Wikidata employs moderators who manually inspect each revision and revert vandalic ones.\nTo help moderators fight vandals, the organizers of WSDM Cup 2017 challenged the participants to build a Machine Learning model which automatically detects if an edit should be rolled back. In this talk we will discuss the second place solution to the Cup: how to process half of terabyte of revisions, extract meaningful features and create a production ready model that scales to a large number of testing examples.\n \nWikidata is a Knowledge Base where anybody can add new information. Unfortunately, it is targeted by vandals, who put inaccurate or offensive information there. To fight them, Wikidata employs moderators, who manually inspect each suggested edit. In this talk we will look into how we can use Machine Learning to automatically detect vandalic revisions and help the moderators.", "Where are we looking? Prediciting human gaze using deep networks.\n \nVisual saliency models aim at describing human eye fixations and finding the most relevant features in a visual scene. From experience one can justify two important processes that drive saliency: First, low level features like color, intensity or orientation contrast and second, high-level features like objects, faces or signs. \nEye fixations serve as an experimental setup to study saliency phenomena and give insight into the ways we attend scenes. Hereby, computational modelling is used to explain what information processing might be responsible for saliency. Evaluating how well models explain observed fixations give a framework of identifying what features contribute to saliency by designing models with different, e.g. high- or low-level feature extractors. \nMany saliency models have used low-level features but were faced with drawbacks in explaining pronounced saliency caused by high-level contributions. Simply adding face or object detectors has been a plausible follow-up but revealed little about the underlying mechanisms.\nRecent advances in object classification by training convolutional neural networks (CNN) have revealed rich filter representations in a wide range of high-level features and are therefore a promising candidate in building models of visual processing (e.g. VGG-19 trained on ImageNet).\n \nWhich features in an image draw our focus to a specific area while neglecting others entirely? This fascinating question has been motivating researchers for decades but also sparked interest in design and marketing. Thus, saliency models aim at identifying locations that stand out from their visual neighbourhood. Using tensorflow and matplotlib this talk will shed some light on these features..", "Social Networks and Protest Participation: Evidence from 130 Million Twitter Users\n \nPinning down the role of social ties in the decision to protest has been notoriously\nelusive, largely due to data limitations. The era of social media and its global use by\nprotesters offers an unprecedented opportunity to observe real-time social ties and\nonline behavior, though often without an attendant measure of real-world behavior. We\ncollect data on Twitter activity during the 2015 Charlie Hebdo protest in Paris which,\nunusually, record real-world protest attendance and high-resolution network structure.\nWe draw on a theory of participation in which protest decisions depend on exposure to\nothers' intentions, and network position determines exposure. Our findings are strong\nand consistent with this theory, showing that, relative to comparable Twitter users,\nprotesters are significantly more connected to one another via direct, indirect, triadic,\nand reciprocated ties. These results offer the first large-scale empirical support for the\nclaim that social network structure has consequences for protest participation.\n \nData mining social networks for evidence of political participation.

One way to inhibit this is to moderate all incoming advertisements by using static filters or having human moderators but this may not go a long way if the business deals with millions of advertisements every day. Static filters may catch good advertisements and flag them as bad and would also require humans to add, remove or improve them. On the other hand employing human moderators to moderate all incoming advertisements does not scale. Creating machine learning models is what we believe is the right way to address this kind of problem. Machine learning models identifies patterns in data and classifies ads thereby reducing the overhead of creating complex filters and reducing number of human moderators\nIn this talk we share our experiences in building machine learning models to act as human moderators. This talk will cover mainly the following topics\n\nCreating a simple platform architecture that can do predictions on millions of requests without spending too much resources on devops and machines\n-- Batching of requests so as to use CPU's optimally. \n-- Containerising code so as to have ease of deployments\nCreating models from training set containing millions of rows and thousands of features which can be trained on simple machines rather than using complex Spark Hadoop Architectures. \n-- Using SVM files as a means data format rather than huge dataframes that can not fit in memory\nOrchestrate model generation pipeline using Luigi workflow.\nControlling error rate using prediction probability thresholds\nEvaluating moderation/fraud detection models.\nManagement of hundreds of models and manage their performance across all geographical regions.\n\n \nIn todays world of online business, it is difficult to moderate all the content coming to your site.

They range from robot parameter tuning and optimization of chemical processes to biological systems analysis.  Typical examples from financial engineering include model calibration, pricing, hedging, VaR/CVaR computation, credit rating assignment, forecasting, strategy optimization in electronic trading systems. The choice of the algorithm for decision making should depend on the type of the objective function and availability of a priori information. Such problems are best approached with a library of optimization methods to help study the nature of the problem. Several such libraries are readily available, such as Matlab Global Optimization Toolbox, that contains a minimal set of modules allowing to create a universe of optimization methods by making hybrids. We suggest to use use Python  scipy and scikit learn.  By varying parameters of the standard optimization procedures and making hybrids it is possible to obtain the whole universe of methods. For example, Nelder Mead algorithm (represented by scipy.optimize.fmin() function) needs a frequent restart  and can be efficiently combined with random search for solving problems of global optimization. Many well known standard tools such as principal component analysis  can be rewritten in a incremental (or online) form using machine learning techniques, where new data is incorporated at each iteration, making such algorithms suitable for big data handling.\n \nMany pressing real world problems can be stated as problems of global optimization, where target function is a  black box.

Many questions immediately come up: Which vectorizer should I use, and why? What's the difference between a \"fit\" and a \"transform\"? What's a document-term matrix, and why is it so sparse? Is it okay for my training data to have more features than observations? What's the appropriate machine learning model to use? And so on...\nIn this tutorial, we'll answer all of those questions, and more! We'll start by walking through the vectorization process in order to understand the input and output formats. Then we'll read a simple dataset into pandas, and immediately apply what we've learned about vectorization.

After testing out several options such as Drake, Pydoit, Luigi, AWS Data Pipeline, and Pinball, we landed on Airflow, an Apache incubating batch processing pipelining and scheduler tool originating from Airbnb, that provides the benefits of pipeline construction as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), along with a scheduler that can handle alerting, retries, callbacks and more to make your pipeline robust. This talk will discuss the value of DAG based pipelines for data processing workflows, highlight useful features in all of the pipelining projects we tested, and dive into some of the specific challenges (like time travel) and successes (like time travel!) we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve experienced using Airflow to productionize our data engineering tasks.

As a result, we want to be able to make the most of our data by extrapolating as much information as possible. In this talk, we will explore the various approaches used in fuzzy string matching and demonstrate how they can be used as a feature in a model or a component in your python code. We will dive deep into the approaches of different algorithms such as Soundex, Trigram/n-gram search, and Levenshtein distances and what the best use cases are. For instance, Levenshtein is great for real time analytics whereas trigram/n-gram works best on a batch data set with appropriate indexes. Finally, we will demonstrate via live coding how to implement some of these fuzzy search algorithms using python and/or PostgreSQL. \n \nSo much of data science is about understanding the context around your data. In this talk, we hope to address how to work with messy text data by leveraging fuzzy search algorithms in python or against a database such as PostgreSQL.

In most cases, the intrinsic dimensionality is much smaller than the observed dimensionality of the data, and it becomes imperative to eliminate unavailing and redundant features before performing the core analysis. This is useful not only because it speeds up the core part of the analysis which typically involves complicated algorithms, but it may also improve the accuracy of the analysis (such as the classification accuracy of a classification model). Multiple feature reduction techniques have been proposed and utilized by statisticians and data scientists over the years. These methods can be broadly categorized into two groups: supervised and unsupervised methods. \nIn this presentation, I will focus on several dimensionality reduction techniques pertaining to the pre-processing of data for supervised learning. A large data-set will be used to demonstrate these techniques by following a dimensionality reduction work-flow. The objective of this presentation is to introduce several dimensionality reduction techniques, demonstrate how to implement them (using Python), and assess their efficacy as it relates to supervised learning problems.\nHere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a list of twelve dimensionality reduction techniques that will be discussed in this presentation: (1) Percent missing values, (2) Amount of variance, (3) Correlation (with the target), (4) Pairwise correlation, (5) Multicollinearity, (6) Principal Component Analysis (PCA), (7) Cluster analysis, (8) Forward selection, (9) Backward elimination, (10) Stepwise selection, (11) LASSO, (12) Tree-based methods.\n \nThis talk provides a step-by-step overview and demonstration of several dimensionality (feature) reduction techniques. Attendees should have some basic level of understanding of data wrangling and supervised learning. The presentation will also include snippets of Python code, so familiarity with Python code will be useful.

They turned this into a freely available open source project, available on Github in R. However, in spite of the prevalence of foodborne illness and its associated costs (as much as $2\u00e2\u0080\u0093$4 billion annually1), so far only one other location in the country has taken advantage of Chicago's work to implement this model.2  That place is Montgomery County, MD which, with the assistance of Open Data Nation, is successfully adapting the model to the local environment.\nThis talk provides an end-to-end demonstration of how to replicate the process using Python and open data from Washington, DC. The content is targeted toward the novice data scientist and will discuss the practical aspects of planning and executing the project.

Data scientists are quickly becoming the caretakers of their organization's data if for no other reason than that we use it the most! That means data scientists must become the guardians of that data.\n\"But that's someone else's job!\" Even if you are part of an organization that's large enough to have a dedicated security team, you should still care about your data.  It's your data.  Your security team isn't working with it every day.  They aren't relying on it for their next big project.  They haven't spent hours upon hours cleaning and tagging. When it comes down to it, you are the person with the most investment in the data.  Can you really trust some far off team to give it the same attention you do?\nIf I haven't already convinced you that this is an important problem, then this talk will really drive the point home.  We'll discuss recent data breaches from Ashley Madison, the IRS and OPM, LinkedIn, Sony, and even Wendy's. Small companies aren't immune either! Hacking activity against small businesses is on the rise and even a single breach can cost a company several hundred thousand dollars in lost revenue.\nThe world is not all dark and scary. There are several relatively easy things you can do to add a great deal of protection. Oftentimes, default security is so lax that just applying a few simple tactics can vastly reduce your attack potential and make you a far less tempting target. We'll discuss access controls on accounts and data, how to do credential management the right way, and dispel the myths around SSL that put people off.  Security isn't free, but it sure can be cheap.\nAfter you get your accounts locked down, you've still got huge datasets that need protection.  Encryption can go a long way to making sure that your hard processed data doesn't get into the hands of some ne'er-do-well. We'll also briefly discuss backup options, since all the encryption in the world can't protect against deletes\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\nFinally, we'll discuss PyCrypto and Openssl for low-level encryption and explore how these libraries can be combined with provider frameworks like Boto to create some very powerful tooling.  We'll conclude with some of the hosted solutions for data storage that have begun providing out-of-the-box security. Audience members can expect to walk away with a better understanding of the hazards we face as data scientists as well as a sense of the full spectrum of security options, from simple tricks you can integrate into your regular scripts, to complete, turn-key security solutions.\n \nYou've got data: lots of it. People want to get their hands on that data. You don't want that, so let's go over a few things you can do to dissuade attackers from getting their grubby mitts on your hard processed datastore. We'll cover the obvious things (spoiler alert: encryption) and then some advanced techniques for keeping data secure while still keeping it usable (that is to say, analyzable).", "Agent-based modeling in Python\n \nAgent-based modeling was an unfilled niche in Python\u00e2\u0080\u0099s robust and growing scientific computing ecosystem, until Mesa was created. Mesa allows users to quickly create agent-based models using built-in core components (such as agent schedulers and networks) or customized implementations; visualize them using an innovative browser-based interface; and analyze their results using Python\u00e2\u0080\u0099s extensive data analysis tools. Mesa is being developed by a group of modeling practitioners with experience in academia, government, and the private sector. It is also completely open-source, encouraging users to contribute to what we hope will be a growing repository of model components which others can reuse and expand upon in future research.\nIn this talk, you will learn the following... \n What are agent-based models & why should I care? (An overview of various agent-based models, the existing software ecosystem, and practical applications)\n What is Mesa? (An overview of Mesa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s features / components and architecture.)\n* How do I a build a model using Mesa? (A walkthrough of how to write a model.)\n \nAgent-based modeling is a technique used to explore both complexity and emergence by simulating individual actors and their actions within a system.

Consequences of database schema not matching the application programming schema. Especially in a more flexible NoSQL context.\n\n\nWays to represent a schema: Code v. Metadata. There are really five cases here. On one hand there's pure code, including completely ad-hoc in the code, via Python class definition. One the other hand there are more formal metadata: packaged with the code, in separate files, or in the database.\n\n\nCommon Use Cases for apps that use a schema definition. We'll look at Python code for a persistent object that serializes itself to MongoDB. This relies on a formal schema definition using the JSON-Schema structure. This includes a simple Python Metaclass to add features to Python's base class definition\n\n\nSchema version management and Schema migration. Some techniques that can help with schema and data migration. \n\n\n \nWhile databases like MongoDB don't require a formal schema, there's still a schema somewhere. It might be merely implied by validation rules in the code. Or, there might be a more formal representation. In some cases, the lack of strict schema creates a dynamic flexibility that creates value rapidly. Other times, the lack of formal structures leads to chaos. How can we find a balance?", "Creating a Contemporary Lending Risk Management System Using Python\n \nEngineering a sophisticated in-house risk management solution for a commercial lending platform doesn't necessarily need to involve millions of lines of low-level code, clunky desktop applications, fancy front-end development, or messy spreadsheets. That is, so long as the problem is approached objectively and the solutions are evaluated critically.\nThis talk will focus on the basics of lending risk mitigation (related to underwriting and portfolio management), a high-level overview of the architectural requirements, and the packages that were leveraged along the way; namely: \n\npandas for data preparation\nOrganizing panels and cleaning time series data\n\n\nstatsmodels and scikit-learn for regression and classification\nPredicting accounts receivable discontinuation and bankruptcy probabilities\n\n\nR/rpy2 for integrating R's advanced forecasting capabilities\nForecast comparison using the forecast package and the bsts package\n\n\nSpyre for designing a lightweight and easily maintainable web application\n\nWe will share a demo of the web application to see how it all comes together, but to be clear, this IS NOT a product pitch or any kind or SaaS; it was built to be used internally and generalizes well for other use cases.\n \nLending involves risk and in order to be a successful lender at scale that risk needs to be mitigated.

These tools are not only very costly ($10k+ per year per license), but are also limited (no scripting ability, very manual). In 2015, we began transitioning into Python to build robust tools and to reduce operational costs. Along the way, we learned a lot about propagating new tools within a company, reverse engineering, and helping others adjust to a new paradigm. This talk will outline our process of evaluating new tools, initial adoption and companywide propagation. One of the main findings was that open source does not mean free, and we had to take into account each person's experience and comfort in devising our implementation strategy. Lastly, we had to develop our own internal library in order to maintain functionality.\n \nDescription in progress", "Python useRs\n \nIt may be better to extend a simple analysis in R than passing around CSV files.\nEven worse, there might be a new analysis package that only exists in R,\nor certain bits infrastructure are already implemented in R and it needs to\nincorporate a bit of Python analysis.\npythonistas can be a #rstats user, they just need examples of the similarities\ndifferences between container objects, functions, dataframes, and how to use Python in an R environment and vice versa.\nThis allows data scientists to work in their preferred language and still use each other's analysis in a larger analysis project.\n \nAccording to the most recent IEEE language rankings, R is now the 5th most popular language.\nIt is the only domain specific language in the top 5, behind the general-purpose languages C, Java, Python, and C++, respectively.\nIt is common for data science teams to work in multiple languages and for the Pythonista,\na working knowledge in R is useful for collaboration, analysis, and performance.", "Promoting a data-driven culture in a world of microservices\n \nWhat you'll learn\nTips for:\n\nExporting from production databases\nBuilding reliable data pipelines\nChoosing which tools to use\nSpreading data literacy at your company\n\nSummary\nA few years ago, Hudl switched from a monolithic app to a microservices architecture. This switch was great for developer productivity and site reliability, but it made it more difficult to get insights on user behaviors. Data was siloed across many databases, so querying across services was difficult or impossible.\nIn July 2015, we created the Data Engineering team in order to make our data more accessible. The Data Engineering team built Fulla, an internal data warehouse containing data from 20+ production databases and billions of logs. Today, squads from all areas of the company use Fulla to track key metrics and trends, make decisions on priorities, and engage with users. \nIn this talk, I discuss all aspects of Fulla. I talk about some of our challenges, including dealing with large scale MongoDB databases, as well as lessons learned on ensuring data quality and promoting a data-driven culture. Finally, I'll provide suggestions on tools to use, both paid and open-source. Tools discussed include Spark, Luigi, Redshift, re:dash, AWS Lambda, Sqoop, Hive, and more. \n \nAt Hudl, we give every employee full access to our data warehouse, and over 50% of our employees have personally written a query against it.

Any ML model developed and thereafter deployed in a production environment might make mistakes either because (1) It did not learn the concept correctly, or (2) the data distribution is non-stationary (concept drift; today more data is organized in the form of data streams rather than static databases, and it is unrealistic to expect that data distributions stay stationary over a long period of time).\nWon't it be great to have models that can learn \u00e2\u0080\u009ccontinuously\u00e2\u0080\u009d from their mistakes (feedback loop) and adapt to an evolving data distribution? While there is a plethora of literature on building models with higher accuracies on test data, this isnt the case when it comes to building ML systems that learn from their mistakes and adapt on the fly. Such system are often called \u00e2\u0080\u009cLearning Machines\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Currently, the standard way to handle feedback and drift is: monitor the performance of the model; If the performance goes below acceptable levels, replace the current model in production with a newly trainined model on the collected feedback & recent data.\nIn this talk we describe our efforts on building ML system that can learn continuously and can adapt on-the-fly to an evolving data distribution. The focus of this talk is on the last leg of the loop, as highlighted in the figure below:\n\nApplied domains\n\nIntroduce non-stationary distributions with examples (we'll observe the results of misclassification rate on our data over a long period of time.) \nIdentify shift in data distribution & labels (For example, we will see how customer preferences (labels) changes over time and how the fallacy of believing that our training sets represent the population, when in reality it is usally a random sample of the current population.)\nIdenitify noise in data\nTemporal nature of data\nRelevant domains that can be addressed with similar learning techniques: Social media, Monitoring and Anamoly detection, Predictions and recommendations\n\nTowards Solution:\nModeling the problem:\nThe problem of instantaneous incorporation of feedback can be modeled as Online Learning: Model sees a data point (x). Makes a prediction y'. The environment reveals the true label y. Model is correct if (y = y') and incorrect if (y != y'). In case the model is wrong, the data point (x,y) is sent to the model as \u00e2\u0080\u009cfeedback\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\nIdeally you would want the model:\n\nTo incorporate this in its learnings i.e. model updates its parameters/weights such that if this data point (x,y) is (ever) again presented to the model, model will output correct label y\nDoes not impact the accuracy of the model on other data points i.e. if prior to incorporating this feedback for all the points where model was predicting correctly, model must continue to do so after the incorporation. In short, in trying to acquire new learning, your model should not forget old (correct) learnings.\n\nDivide and Conquer\nWe borrow the ideas from algorithms (Perceptron, Crammer's PA-II variants) suitable for online settings to build fast learning per-user statistical model with dearth of data leading to temporal retention - we call this Local model. In addition, we perform online passive aggressive updates to combat high degree of noise in the training set. Each message is used to update the model. We use the aggressive & passive parameters to tweak the learning rates on the local model.\nFurther, we use Deep Neural Nets to build model where a glut of data is available leading to persistent retention - we call this Global model.\nWe use cassandra to store-serve models which acts as the distributed file system with a database.\nWe build on the work of Drift Detection (Gama et.al. 2004, Garc\u00c2\u00b4ia et.al. 2006 and Minku et.al. 2012) to refine the training window.\nEnsemble Manager\nWhile both cost-sensitive learning and online learning have been studied extensively, the effort in simultaneously dealing with these two issues is limited. Our key idea is based on the fusion of online ensemble algorithms and the state of the art batch mode cost-sensitive bagging/boosting algorithms. Within this framework, two separately developed research areas - cost-sensitive learning and online learning algorithms are bridged together.\nSummary\nWhile building models with better accuracies is critical (and thats what Machine Learning addresses); from the view point of a practitioner in industry its important to realise that Machine Learning is only a part of End-to-End cycle of building ML systems. An important piece of this endeavour is to build machines that can learn continuously - i.e. to learn from mistakes and adapt to evolving data. In this talk we elaborate our attempts and results towards building such machines. To the best of our knowledge though such systems have been built (google, fb etc), there isn't much literature/resources around them. We hope our talk will help and inspire the community to make serious attempts to bring better science to this art.\n \nIn this talk we explore how to build Machine Learning Systems that can that can learn \"continuously\" from their mistakes (feedback loop) and adapt to an evolving data distribution.

In this talk, we work towards developing Logistic models to predict traffic for Capital Bikeshare, and work towards finding optimal station locations for Network expansion.", "Variational Inference in Python\n \nBayesian inference has proven to be a valuable approach to many machine learning problems.  Unfortunately, many interesting Bayesian models do not have closed-form posterior distributions.  Simulation via the family Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms is the most popular method of approximating the posterior distribution for these analytically intractible models.  While these algorithms (appropriately used) are guaranteed to converge to the posterior given sufficient time, they are often difficult to scale to large data sets and hard to parallelize.  Variational inference is an alternative approach that approximates intractible posteriors through optimization instead of simulation.  By restricting the class of approximating distributions, variational inference allows control of the tradeoff between computational complexity and accuracy of the approximation.  Variational inference can also take advantage of stochastic and parallel optimization algorithms to scale to large data sets.  One drawback of variational inference is that in its most basic form, it can require a lot of model-specific manual calculations.  Recent mathematical advances in black box variational inference (BBVI) and automatic differentiation variational inference (ADVI) along with advances in open source computational frameworks such as Theano and TensorFlow have made variational inference more accessible to non-specialists.  This talk will begin with an introduction to variational inference, BBVI, and ADVI, then illustrate some of the software packages (PyMC3 and Edward) that make these variational inference algorithms available to Python developers.\n \nInference in Bayesian models often requires simulation to approximate posterior distributions.

In Python, scripts are usually dynamically typed and perform one computation at a time, representing two aspects that can be optimized to improve performance. Static typing can be achieved with Cython, a static compiler from Python to C. Parallel processing can be used to take advantage of all the cores present in a machine or a cluster, through the ipyparallel module. While both Cython and ipyparallel can be used in any Python environment, the Jupyter Notebook makes their implementation very simple and is the ideal environment in which to learn the basics about both of these tools.\nThe session will cover the following topics:\n- Installing the ipyparallel module\n- Using the Client class to assign tasks to individual cores\n- Synchronous and asynchronous execution of tasks\n- Use of the %px magic command\n- Statically defining variables and functions using Cython\n- Making modules available to Cython through the use of cimport\n- Numba as an alternative to Cython\n \nAs the complexity and scope of applications grow, it is very common to run into slow performance issues.

Even though they are read and responded to, often such data is ignored when thinking about larger scale trend analysis and this can result in missed insight about how users react to a product or service. Sometimes analysis is being done by looking at changes in user sentiment or other heuristics, however it could be taken a step further by applying predictive modeling in attempt to recognize areas that need more attention and support. While you can use predictive modeling on network and log data, that is looking at how the hardware is handling your users requests, not how it's being perceived by users. By predicting areas where users are having difficulty whether it's with the UI or with the platform's response time you can triage these areas of concern to prevent future cases of negative perception. This talk will cover how to utilize common NLP tools used to gather and process the features in Python then will use R to perform trend analysis and predictive modeling then use the results to triage what areas should be focused on in the future.\n \nThis talk will cover how to use predictive modeling on unstructured text data including feedback form, social media or chat message data to triage issues in order to prevent future problems with a service, platform or user interface using NLP techniques in Python and R.", "Machine Learning Techniques for Class Imbalances & Adversaries\n \nThe Data Innovation Lab at Capital One has explored more advanced modeling techniques for class imbalance & adversarial actors.

As the data science community tackles larger problems with larger hardware we naturally ask how best to parallelize this software stack both across many cores in a single computer and across computers in a cluster. This turns out to be harder than it looks, even with traditional Big Data tools like MapReduce, Storm, and Spark. Both the complexity of the algorithms and the high expectations for interactivity raise challenges for these systems.

It makes sense of everything from cancer trials to package delivery logistics. But all is not well with data science. Over the past decade, multiple studies have been found to be unreliable and non-reproducible when other scientists tried to recreate their results. This is due to a variety of factors, including fraud, pressure to publish, improper data handling practices, and bugs in analytic tools.\nThe problems faced by data science mirror problems that software engineering has been trying to solve. While there are no silver bullets to guarantee quality software, techniques have been developed over time that have improved quality and reliability. Some of these techniques, including open source, version control, automation, and fuzzing could be adapted to the data science domain to improve reliability and help address the reproducibility crisis.\n \nData science is the backbone of modern scientific discovery and industry. Unfortunately, multiple recent studies have been found to be unreliable and non-reproducible. Adopting techniques from software engineering might help mitigate some of these problems.", "Data Transformation: A Framework for Exploratory Data Analysis\n \nAt the heart of data analysis, there lies a need to understand the real world entities being represented in the data. Every data set we encounter is an attempt to capture a slice of our complex world and communicate some information about it in a way that has potential to be informative to humans, machines, or both. Moving from basic analyses to advanced analytics requires the ability to imagine multiple ways of conceptualizing the composition of entities and the relationships present in our data. It also requires the realization that different levels of aggregation, disaggregation, and transformation can open up new pathways to understanding our data and identifying the valuable insights it contains.\nIn this talk, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll discuss several ways to think about the composition and representation of our data. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll also demonstrate a series of methods that leverage tools like networks, hierarchical aggregations, and unsupervised clustering to visually explore our data, transform it to discover new insights, help frame analytical problems and questions, and even improve machine learning model performance. In exploring these approaches, and with the help of Python libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Seaborn, and NetworkX, we will provide a practical framework for thinking creatively and visually about your data and unlocking latent value and insights hidden deep beneath its surface.\n \nExploratory data analysis plays a critical role in the job of every data scientist, but very few have a structured process or framework for exploring data quickly and efficiently.

The main goal is to automate data scraping/downloading and reshaping. I use python to automate data gathering, and Tableau and D3 as visualization tools -- but the process can be applied to numerous analytical/visualization suites. \nI'll discuss situations where a dashboard makes sense (and when one doesn't). I will make a case also that automation makes for a more seamless data gathering and updating process, but not always for smarter data analysis.\nSome python packages I'll cover for web scraping and downloading/reshaping open data include: openpyxl, pandas, xlsxwriter, and BeautifulSoup. I'll also touch on APIs.\nThe case study for this talk, and the source of the example data visualizations, will be the Economic Intelligence Dashboard (https://open.dc.gov/economic-intelligence/). This public dashboard is a curated collection of open data from disparate sources which, taken together, form a narrative of the economic health of DC. As my main field of focus is on economic data, throughout the talk I will touch on the best (most authoritative; easiest to scrape) sources of economic data and data on the District and the region. \n \nDistilling a world of data down to a few key indicators can be an effective way of keeping an audience informed, and this concept is at the heart of a good dashboard.

", "Dynamics in Graph Analysis: Adding Time as a Structure for Visual and Statistical Insight\n \nModeling data as networks of relationships between entities can be a powerful method for both visual analytics and machine learning; people are very good at distinguishing patterns from interconnected structures, and machine learning methods get a performance improvement when applied to graph data structures. However, as these structures become more complex or embed more information over time, both visual and algorithmic methods get messy; visual analyses suffer from the \"hairball\" effect, and graph algorithms require either more traversal or increased computation at each vertex. A growing area to reduce this complexity and optimize analytics is the use of interactive and subgraph techniques that model how graph structures change over time.\nIn this talk, I demonstrate two practical techniques for embedding time into graphs, not as computational properties, but rather as structural elements. The first technique is to add time as a node to the graph, which allows the graph to remain static and complete, but minimizes traversals and allows filtering. The second is to represent a single graph as multiple subgraphs where each is a snapshot at a particular time. This allows us to use time series analytics on our graphs, but perhaps more importantly, to use animation or interactive methodologies to visually explore those changes and provide meaningful dynamics.\nWe explore these dynamics using a concept graph extracted from a natural language corpus using NLP techniques as well as a graph of GitHub commits. The creation and analysis of the graphs will be conducted via NetworkX and the visualization aspects will be conducted using Graph Tool and matplotlib. An outline is as follows: \n\nAn introduction to our graphs and possible insights\nWhere can we find the time? Data wrangling for time as a property\nStatic analyses: moving time from a property model to a structural element \nTraversals and subgraphs of time\nThe \"betweenness\" of time and new node proximities \nA small overview of network visualization \nVisualizing static layouts with timely edge properties \nAdding dynamics for interactive analysis\nAnimating the change in structure of a graph over time \nFinding insights with visual analytics: overview first, zoom and filter, details on demand. \n\nAll code will be made open source, as will the data sets that we collect! \n \nNetwork analyses are powerful methods for both visual analytics and machine learning but can suffer as their complexity increases. By embedding time as a structural element rather than a property, we will explore how time series and interactive analysis can be improved on Graph structures. Primarily we will look at decomposition in NLP-extracted concept graphs using NetworkX and Graph Tool. ", "Design Principles\n \nComing Soon!\n \nComing Soon!", "Logistic Regression: Behind the Scenes\n \nThe logistic regression model is a powerful linear model for predicting the log-odds of a binary or multi-class response. Empirically, carefully built logistic models perform well on many diverse tasks including survival analysis and classification problems.  Business requirements often impose statistical constraints on modelers (e.g. interpretability) making logistic regression a standard industry tool.\nMany organizations, including Capital One, are experimenting with the transition from SAS to open source tools such as Python; during this transition, modelers must confront a multitude of options for performing old tasks in new ways, including which package(s) to use for fitting logistic models.  This naturally raises many questions: are the same tweaks and options still available (e.g., offsets, Firth adjustment)?  Can we reproduce the exact same output and trust the results (e.g., p-values, coefficient estimates)?  How should a modeler navigate the different numerical implementations?\nIn this talk, we will take a deep dive into logistic regression, with a focus on performance and output comparisons between SAS and various Python packages.

The Illusion of Intelligence  \n \nChatbots are programs that employ rules or artificial intelligence that users interact with via a dialogue interface. Chatbots are extremely useful tools for accomplishing a range of tasks. From ordering pizza to checking the weather to buying shoes, there's a chatbot for that. This bot revolution has led to the creation of several Make-A-Bot services (all with really cool .ai domains!), but these bots are not extremely powerful examples of artificial intelligence. Most are simple template-based implementations that can be developed independently in Python. \nThis talk will provide an overview on the structure of chatbots and how tools such as SpaCy, NLTK, sklearn, and Keras can be used to develop bots ranging from a basic weather bot to a more sophisticated deep learning neural conversation model. The applicability of these tools will be demonstrated through MalBot, a chatbot capable of ingesting a piece of malware and responding to natural language inquiries into the malicious software\u00e2\u0080\u0099s capabilities. (e.g. \"Do you record key strokes?\", \"What malware family are you from?\")\nAttendees will gain a better understanding of the foundations of chatbot development and the Python tools necessary to successfully build and deploy their own bot.\n \nChatbots have become wildly popular interfaces for online services we use everyday.

However, graphs are not the primary representation choice for storing most data today. Individuals and businesses instead tend to choose more general purpose storage systems, the most popular being relational databases, often preferred for the strong integrity and consistency guarantees they provide. In these cases, users are therefore forced to manually extract data from their data stores, construct the requisite graphs, and then load them into a graph engine (like NetworkX) to execute their graph analysis task. Moreover, users may not know exactly which graphs in their dataset they would like to analyze, or they may be unsure about whether a particular graph would be useful or not. This process is not only tedious and cumbersome, but also computationally intensive and time-consuming.\nWe present a system called GraphGen, geared towards making the extraction of graphs from relational databases effortless as well as enabling the visual exploration of the wide variety of inherent or hidden graphs inside structured relational datasets. GraphGen consists of a Web application for visual exploration of the potential graphs, as well as a Python library called GraphGenPy for using our intuitive domain specific language (DSL) to declare graph extraction tasks, that are automatically executed over a relational database. In this talk, I will discuss the challenges in achieving the above goals as well as provide an overview of the end-to-end process using GraphGenPy and NetworkX for leveraging graph analysis over a relational database schema.\n \nApplying graph analytics on data stored in relational databases can provide tremendous value in many application domains.

By tapping into one of our most essential resources \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the human visual cortex \u00e2\u0080\u0094 they can enable us to see patterns rendered opaque by numeric outputs and tabular data, and lead us toward more robust programs and better data products. For Python programmers who dabble in machine learning, visual diagnostics can mean the difference between a model that crashes and burns, and one that predicts the future.\nPython and high level libraries like Scikit-Learn, NLTK, TensorFlow, PyBrain, Theano, and MLPY have made machine learning accessible to a broad programming community that might never have found it otherwise. With the democratization of these tools, there are now a great many machine learning practitioners who are primarily self-taught. At the same time, the stakes of machine learning have never been higher; predictive tools are driving decision-making in every sector, from business, art, and engineering to education, law, and defense. In an age where any Python programmer can harness the power of predictive analytics, how do we ensure our models are valid and robust? How can we identify problems such as local minima and overfit? How can we build intuition around model selection? How can we isolate and combine the most informative features? Whether you have an academic background in predictive methods or not, visual diagnostics are the key to augmenting the algorithms already implemented in Python.\nIn this talk, I present a suite of visualization tools within and outside the standard Scikit-learn library that Python programmers can use to evaluate their machine learning models' performance, stability, and predictive value. I then identify some of the key gaps in the current visual diagnostics arsenal, and propose some novel possibilities for the future.\nOUTLINE\n\n\nIntroduction/Problem statement\n\nMachine learning made accessible via the Scikit-learn API\nBut what kinds of things can go wrong?      \nAnscombe's quartet: An argument for using visual diagnostics\n\n\n\nVisual tools for feature analysis and selection\n\nThe model selection triple: What it is and how it can support the ML workflow\nEffective feature analysis is key to informed machine learning\nVisualizations can facilitate feature selection (boxplots/violinplots, histograms, sploms, radviz, parallel coordinates and more)\n\n\n\nDemystifying model selection\n\nTree diagrams and graph traversal for model selection: The Scikit-learn algorithm cheatsheet, Sayed's data mining map\nCluster and classifier comparison plots\nModel evaluation to support selection (Confusion matrices, ROC curves, prediction error plots, residual plots)  \n\n\n\nTaking hyperparameter tuning out of the black box\n\nVisualizing parameters with validation curves    \nDeveloping intuition through visual grid search\n\n\n\nOpen source Python packages for more informed machine learning\n\nYellowbrick: Aggregating the tools available in Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas and Bokeh\nTrinket: Wrapping the entire machine learning workflow\n\n\n\n \nVisualization has a critical role to play throughout the analytic process.

Algorithms are everywhere we look (and even places we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look) controlling what we see, do, and where we go. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re great for solving our problems and helping us make better and quicker decisions, or taking the decision-making out of our hands. Their guidance is perfect in their objective and unbiased calculation. Except they are not, actually. Like everything else, they are created by people, and people have biases that get encoded into the algorithms they create. Algorithms learn from data, which is also created by people, so the algorithms also learn biases from data. This can be a problem when algorithms encode these biases into their calculations and go on to perpetuate the bias. \nIn this talk you will hear why we should care about algorithmic accountability, and details on a case study on how computational journalism can be used to investigate algorithms and advocate the need for transparency and accountability.\n \nAlgorithms have become an integral part of our everyday lives.

", "Deep Language Modeling for Question Answering using Keras\n \nQuestion answering has received more focus as large search engines have basically mastered general information retrieval and are starting to cover more edge cases. Question answering happens to be one of those edge cases, because it could involve a lot of syntatic nuance that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get captured by standard information retrieval models, like BM-25 or LSI. Hypothetically, deep learning models are better suited to this type of task because of their ability to capture higher-order syntax.

Simple matching of these records does not result in the correct identification of existing duplicates for various reasons such as noisy and incomplete records.\nMethodology:\nIn this work, we build on top of a python package that uses active learning to create a labeled data set, train a linear regression model on that sample and then derive predicate rules to speed up the pairwise comparisons of records before matching them. This existing enhanced methodology improves duplicates identification with a high level of performance but doesn't scale effectively.\n  In order to provide scalability, our application creates an initial model on a sample of the data and then updates the model as more batches of records are added to the database, all the while de-duplicating those records by merging them with existing entries.\n  Our contributions consist of:\n1.  Applying a cluster updating model to properly add additional batches of records to the existing cluster when applicable or creating new cluster. Each unique patient is represented by a cluster.\n2.  Produce a scalable solution capable of processing millions or records and updating the cluster representatives and records assignments, all under the constraints of the patient information protection rules.  \n \nSimple matching to identify duplicates in patient records produces numerous errors for various reasons.

The landscape of this skillset is rapidly changing and difficult to pinpoint at an interdisciplinary level. The modern researcher is expected to navigate digital tools that are not unique to the work that they do on a daily basis within their discipline and to be able to share that work in meaningful ways with collaborators. \nOpen science has become increasingly relevant to modern scientific practice and reflects the development of the modern research skill set. There is a rising tide of policy that requires researchers to navigate open methodology in order to gain access to grant funding. Despite a shift towards support of open science in major policy making bodies, such as the OECD, the training that early career researchers receive has not caught up with this fast changing policy landscape. \nThis talk will define a modern research skill set, its relevance to the principles of open science, and the need for a better understanding of open practice and of tools and strategies that improve the reproducibility of scientific findings.

However, as these structures become more complex or embed more information over time, both visual and algorithmic methods get messy; visual analyses suffer from the \"hairball\" effect, and graph algorithms require either more traversal or increased computation at each vertex. A growing area to reduce this complexity and optimize analytics is the use of interactive and subgraph techniques that model how graph structures change over time.\nIn this talk, I demonstrate two practical techniques for embedding time into graphs, not as computational properties, but rather as structural elements. The first technique is to add time as a node to the graph, which allows the graph to remain static and complete, but minimizes traversals and allows filtering. The second is to represent a single graph as multiple subgraphs where each is a snapshot at a particular time. This allows us to use time series analytics on our graphs, but perhaps more importantly, to use animation or interactive methodologies to visually explore those changes and provide meaningful dynamics.\nWe explore these dynamics using a concept graph extracted from a natural language corpus using NLP techniques as well as a graph of GitHub commits. The creation and analysis of the graphs will be conducted via NetworkX and the visualization aspects will be conducted using Graph Tool and matplotlib. An outline is as follows: \n\nAn introduction to our graphs and possible insights\nWhere can we find the time? Data wrangling for time as a property\nStatic analyses: moving time from a property model to a structural element \nTraversals and subgraphs of time\nThe \"betweenness\" of time and new node proximities \nA small overview of network visualization \nVisualizing static layouts with timely edge properties \nAdding dynamics for interactive analysis\nAnimating the change in structure of a graph over time \nFinding insights with visual analytics: overview first, zoom and filter, details on demand. \n\nAll code will be made open source, as will the data sets that we collect! \n \nNetwork analyses are powerful methods for both visual analytics and machine learning but can suffer as their complexity increases. By embedding time as a structural element rather than a property, we will explore how time series and interactive analysis can be improved on Graph structures. Primarily we will look at decomposition in NLP-extracted concept graphs using NetworkX and Graph Tool. ", "Transforming Data to Unlock Its Latent Value\n \nAt the heart of data analysis, there lies a need to understand the real world entities being represented in the data. Every data set we encounter is an attempt to capture a slice of our complex world and communicate some information about it in a way that has potential to be informative to humans, machines, or both. Moving from basic analyses to advanced analytics requires the ability to imagine multiple ways of conceptualizing the composition of entities and the relationships present in our data. It also requires the realization that different levels of aggregation, disaggregation, and transformation can open up new pathways to understanding our data and identifying the valuable insights it contains.\nIn this talk, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll discuss several ways to think about the composition and representation of our data.

One of our main research areas is sensor fusion whereby on-aircraft, real-time software compares and fuses tracks from all of the onboard sensors as well as those reported by other aircraft in the area. Track association is one component of sensor fusion. By association we are referring to the decision made by the fusion engine as to whether two or more track reports represent the same physical entity (\u00e2\u0080\u009ctrack matching\"). Track reports may be provided by the same sensor, different sensors on a single aircraft, or multiple sensors across multiple aircraft. Assessing the performance of the sensor fusion algorithms requires an aggregate analysis across a large set of flight test data both from a mission perspective (single mission, but looking at data from multiple aircraft) and across multiple missions (evaluating performance over time and across a wide range of test conditions). This talk will focus on the post-flight assessment process related to track association decisions. \nData Preparation\nIn order to analyze and compare tracks (time series reports on the position and movement of a physical entity) it is necessary to address any time alignment issues, perform coordinate transformations to get all tracks into a common coordinate frame, and store the data in a format that facilitates aggregate analysis. The time alignment related challenges stem from the fact that the data is recorded on multiple asynchronous digital interfaces. Also, time synchronization between aircraft is not robust and can require time shifting some of the recordings.\u00c2\u00a0Prior to ingesting the data, the track reports vary widely in the coordinate frame used. Some sensors only report in a single dimension (e.g. azimuth only), others in two (e.g. azimuth and elevation), and others in three (e.g. azimuth, elevation, and range or latitude, longitude and altitude). Some of the sensors report the tracks kinematic information in addition to its position which can also vary by coordinate frame. We have found pandas\u00e2\u0080\u0099 powerful data manipulation capabilities and its extensive time series data support to be very effective in both preparing the data for analysis as well as the analysis itself.\nStatistical Comparison\nOnce the tracks are on the same time scale and in the same coordinate frame, we can compare tracks to each other (either from the same aircraft or different aircraft) and compare them to \u00e2\u0080\u009ctruth\u00e2\u0080\u009d (the best state estimates available for the relevant physical entities in the airspace).

We receive billions of location data points per day for user locations. We need to filter this data and map it to millions of points of interest. Our end use case is to provide clients with information as to the attributes of users who visit their stores. This workflow, however, has application to the broader analytical problem of mapping geospatially located entities of interest to points of interest with known locations. We also provide our approach to the frequently encountered issue of needing both standardized and flexible reporting. We have automated the standard analyses in our workflow, but created an API for analysts to quickly develop ad-hoc analyses based on customer requests. \nThere are freely available tools to the Python user that can help us complete all of the tasks in our data analysis pipeline. At a high level, the architecture of our process is as follows: HDFS storage for large-scale geospatial data, Spark for geospatial joins, Cloudera Impala accessed via Ibis to query resultant datasets, and scientific python for conducting analyses. We make the automated analyses to the end users via a web portal created using Flask and Celery. We created an API available to analysts as a Python package so that they can quickly perform custom analyses created by clients. We used Sphinx to aid in documentation for easier use of the API.\nIn this talk we describe our architecture and workflow to accomplish the following analytical tasks related to user location:\n1.) Estimation of the user\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approximate home location (within a few miles)\n2.) Estimation of approximate demographic characteristics of visitors to a location\n3.) Distribution of distances traveled to reach a specific location\n4.) Distribution of visit propensities over time\nWe also describe an analytic technique used to statistically determine the impact of treatment on user\u00e2\u0080\u0099s geographical behavior patterns using propensity-based test and control groups.  \nPython is the only language with tools readily available to efficiently complete this task end-to-end.\n \nWe created an automated framework for analysis of large-scale geospatial data using Spark, Impala, and Python.

If we go back in time thirty some years we find the exact opposite. What happened to the stem-and-leaf plot? Finding the answer led me to design and implement an improved graphical version of the stem-and-leaf plot, as a python package. As a companion to the talk, a printed research paper will be provided to the audience.\nBackground\nWhat were the design challenges? What about other options for visualizing distributions? These questions will be answered in this part of the talk.\nDemonstration\nFrom the standalone command line tool, to the python package, there are many ways to take advantage of stemgraphic. This section of the talk will be all about live demos, at the command line and in a Jupyter notebook.\nDesign and Implementation\nIn this section we will talk about specific design decisions (such as fonts, colors, default options, number of data points, scaling) and about a few implementation details.\nPerformance\nProbably the most important question when it comes to usability of a tool designed for exploratory data analysis, data mining etc. How fast is it? This section will include some more demonstrations.\nFuture work\nStem_graphic is an open source python module that implements a fast and easy to use, highly configurable graphical stem-and-leaf plot. The best feature? Without any data wrangling or having to think about options, it provides a visually appealing, usable plot. But there is always room for improvement. We'll wrap up the talk mentioning some of the enhancements on the horizon.\nQuestions?\n \nJohn Tukey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stem-and-leaf plot first appeared in 1970. Although very useful back then, it cannot handle more than 300 data points and is completely text-based. Stemgraphic is a very easy to use python package providing a solution to these limitations. In this talk you will learn to use stemgraphic, see it in action with very large datasets and understand what drove the design decisions.", "Scikit-build: A build system generator for CPython C extensions.\n \nAlthough the scientific packages NumPy, SciPy, SymEngine or Matplotlib can be used from Python today, since they bundle C, C++ or Fortan extensions, successfully building the associated binary wheels is complex and prone to errors. This is a significant barrier to allow use of these scientific packages on a broader set of platforms like mobile, Raspberry Pi or HPC.\nTo facilitate the build process, the scikit-build package is fundamentally just glue between the setuptools Python module and CMake. Currently, the package is available to perform builds in a setup.py file. In the future, the project aims to be a build tool option in the currently developing pyproject.toml build system specification.\n \nIn this talk we present \"scikit-build\", an improved build system generator for CPython C extensions.

This makes analysis easier, but doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t accurately reflect real-life. What happens when we move eye tracking into a more realistic, dynamic setting, using eye tracking glasses that allow people to move around? People can interact with objects in a much more natural manner, but a new challenge is introduced: We only have gaze data with respect to the glasses frame of reference. In order to apply conventional analysis methods to these data, we need to map dynamic gaze back onto a static reference image, compensating for distance, head movement, and perspective.\nUsing the OpenCV package and its efficient implementations of common computer vision algorithms, we developed a method to find objects of interest in video from eye tracking glasses and return gaze coordinates over those objects, enabling experimenters to apply conventional data analysis methods to eye tracking behavior obtained in dynamic, real-world situations.\n \nUsing computer vision techniques, we extended eye tracking technology to allow for data normalization across dynamic environments.

By tapping into one of our most essential resources \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the human visual cortex \u00e2\u0080\u0094 they can enable us to see patterns rendered opaque by numeric outputs and tabular data, and lead us toward more robust programs and better data products. For Python programmers who dabble in machine learning, visual diagnostics can mean the difference between a model that crashes and burns, and one that predicts the future.\nPython and high level libraries like Scikit-Learn, NLTK, TensorFlow, PyBrain, Theano, and MLPY have made machine learning accessible to a broad programming community that might never have found it otherwise. With the democratization of these tools, there are now a great many machine learning practitioners who are primarily self-taught. At the same time, the stakes of machine learning have never been higher; predictive tools are driving decision-making in every sector, from business, art, and engineering to education, law, and defense. In an age where any Python programmer can harness the power of predictive analytics, how do we ensure our models are valid and robust? How can we identify problems such as local minima and overfit? How can we build intuition around model selection? How can we isolate and combine the most informative features? Whether you have an academic background in predictive methods or not, visual diagnostics are the key to augmenting the algorithms already implemented in Python.\nIn this talk, I present a suite of visualization tools within and outside the standard Scikit-learn library that Python programmers can use to evaluate their machine learning models' performance, stability, and predictive value. I then identify some of the key gaps in the current visual diagnostics arsenal, and propose some novel possibilities for the future.\nOUTLINE\n\n\nIntroduction/Problem statement\n\nMachine learning made accessible via the Scikit-learn API\nBut what kinds of things can go wrong?      \nAnscombe's quartet: An argument for using visual diagnostics\n\n\n\nVisual tools for feature analysis and selection\n\nThe model selection triple: What it is and how it can support the ML workflow\nEffective feature analysis is key to informed machine learning\nVisualizations can facilitate feature selection (boxplots/violinplots, histograms, sploms, radviz, parallel coordinates and more)\n\n\n\nDemystifying model selection\n\nTree diagrams and graph traversal for model selection: The Scikit-learn algorithm cheatsheet, Sayed's data mining map\nCluster and classifier comparison plots\nModel evaluation to support selection (Confusion matrices, ROC curves, prediction error plots, residual plots)  \n\n\n\nTaking hyperparameter tuning out of the black box\n\nVisualizing parameters with validation curves    \nDeveloping intuition through visual grid search\n\n\n\nOpen source Python packages for more informed machine learning\n\nYellowbrick: Aggregating the tools available in Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas and Bokeh\nTrinket: Wrapping the entire machine learning workflow\n\n\n\n \nVisualization has a critical role to play throughout the analytic process.

Predicting the behaviors of potential consumers is a challenging task in the online advertising business. These valuable user actions can be quite rare, and there may be a dearth of information available for modeling each user. Having an accurate model for prediction of user behaviors allows a business to minimize the cost of serving ads to users who would not be influenced by them while maximizing the occurrence of user actions for which the business gets paid.\nIn practice there may be a number of ways to model these behaviors and ensembling the results together may result in the best prediction.  One useful model attempts to predict whether users who have previously visited a web site will return and make a purchase, if they are subsequently served an ad. This so called retargeting model can be modeled as a supervised classification problem with both time varying and time invariant features. \nThis presentation will illustrate some of the concepts behind creating a retargeting model, using data provided by Maxpoint, from model conceptualization to deployment.

This project is to use the game as a test bed to experiment and implement various machine learning algorithms in Python to gain insight in building video game AI and AI in general.\nIn LaserCat, the player controls the cat to shoot the mouse-saucers that are flying across the screen from left to right. The player gains positive score from each kill, and gains negative score from letting the cat collide with the mouse-saucer or letting the mouse-saucer escape.\nWe start with building an imitation AI that can imitate a human player's decision-making. We recorded 2 hours of my gameplay as training data, including the coordinates of cat, lasers, and mice, as well as the action I chose to execute in each frame. Then it becomes a supervised learning problem in which the coordinates are the predictors and my action is the response. \nHowever, not all the coordinates are available at any given time. We handle the missing values with a hierarchical random forest model: We divide the data into 32 subsets according to the 32 missing value patterns, and train a random forest model with the scikit-learn library for each subset. Then, when the imitation AI plays the game, in each frame, it extracts the coordinates of all the objects on the screen, identifies the missing value pattern, and uses the corresponding random forest to predict the action that the human player would take. \nNext, we consider the more interesting and challenging problem of building a self-evolving AI that can learn on its own. It is a reinforcement learning problem in which the goal is to maximize the score gained per minute. In reinforcement learning, the AI has to learn the optimum strategy by an educated trial and error. \nAll the coordinates in each frame are too much information for the AI to learn efficiently. So we simplify the information from each frame by building a grid that moves with the leading mouse to track the cat's approximate relative position. Then we implement Bayesian Q-learning to let the AI learn the best action to take given the cat's position in the grid. The AI cat gets smarter and smarter as it plays the game and explores different actions. After 7 hours of training, the AI is able to play on a super-human level.\n \nIn this talk we will look at a few machine learning algorithms and their Python implementations to build AI's that can play LaserCat, a video game written with Pygame. We start with building an imitation AI that can imitate a human player's decision-making. Then we build a self-evolving AI that can explore and learn on its own to eventually achieve super-human level.

This is compounded by the fact that often multiple analysts are responsible for contributing to these analyses.  We demonstrate a way of addressing this problem in which we (1) divide a large set of features into smaller sets of features with easily interpretable labels, (2) fit a separate model for each feature subset in order to obtain predictors for the ensembling model, and then (3) combine these separate predictors via ensemble learning.  We also assess each predictor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s importance in the ensembled model. We implement this solution in Python, leaning heavily on sklearn, taking advantage of Python\u00e2\u0080\u0099s flexibility and ease-of-use both in software development and data analysis.\nWe describe the modeling framework in detail and present a case study demonstrating our approach by modeling the weekly sales volume of household goods across many locations of a national retail chain that yields models that leverage the predictive information of many variables without sacrificing interpretability.

But this is not always the best format. Robustly parsing CSV files is challenging, see for example, the number of optional parameters accepted by the read_csv function in Pandas. CSV files also lose type information, since all fields must be strings or numeric, encoding categorical variables is difficult. \nThe Hadoop and Spark communities have solved this data serialization problem many times over. Among the more popular file formats are Avro, Parquet, and Arrow. Each is optimized for a different use, Avro for JSON-like data, Arrow for tabular data, and Parquet for columnar data. Similar to the CSV format, these new formats are supported by a wide range of reader/parsers, ensuring data written by an Hadoop task and later be read by PySpark.\nWes McKinney and Hadley Wickham recently created the Feather format, aimed at making it easier to share data between languages, specifically Python and R. Feather is most similar to Arrow, although Feather is meant for on-disk representation instead of in-memory. Among the many advantages of using Feather instead of CSV files to cross the language boundary is the incredible speedup that comes from removing the parser. Aside from some metadata, reading a Feather files does not require any parsing, the on-disk representation of various column types such as integer, floating point, and categorical are mirrors of their in-memory representation in Python and R.\nIn this talk, we'll do a deep dive on the Feather format, manually deconstructing the on-disk representation with some struct and NumPy magic.\n \nFeather, Avro, Parquet, Arrow... all these new file formats, what's wrong with good old CSVs?

These systems work seamlessly with the operator's inputs to move the machine and perform work such as digging, loading, dozing, hauling, etc.  The function of the machine is managed by very complex embedded software which allow for a range of operator environments and styles while continuously attempting to optimize machine productivity, fuel usage, and operator comfort.  \nThe design and testing of the integrated powertrain system (IPS) control software is therefore critical to proper performance of the engine and transmission across a wide variety of operation and driving styles.  Caterpillar IPS control software has historically been validated by manually selecting cycles from limited test data.  Consequently the risk that the software may not be optimal is higher than desired since the sample size is small.  \nThe advent of relatively cheap, integrated data-loggers that can record many parameters at high sampling frequencies has greatly increased the amount and variety of recorded operator styles and customer applications.  There is now ample data from which to sample.  However, in order to avoid sample bias, we desire that extracted time histories only be drawn from predominant patterns.  \nThe data is so large that manually looking for patterns would be exorbitantly time-consuming.  A programmatic approach is needed to reduce and categorize the data.  However, simple reduction of data into summary statistics does not preserve the time-dependence of patterns (gear shifting, engine acceleration or deceleration).  Nor does attempting to match waveforms exactly since the patterns can be time-dilated or time-reordered.\nTherefore, we present a method to divide the data into time-period sessions and pull out specially-engineered features that can be subsequently mined for patterns.  This involves domain expertise as well as programming knowledge.  Python is used to create the features (numpy, scipy, pandas), and the feature space is grouped into patterns through dimensionality reduction and unsupervised learning (scikit-learn).  The scalability problem is addressed by building a functional programming pipeline on a distributed task queue (pytoolz, celery).\nWe will discuss this method and (if time permits) some challenges we face related to data storage, data access, distributed computing, function serialization, workflow design, and analytical modeling.  We will conclude with a reflection on the value to controls development that this method realizes, what works well, and where the process can be improved.\n \nIdentifying predominant driving-style patterns in logged time series data of Caterpillar machines is daunting due to the nature and size of the data.  However, insight gained from field data can deliver optimized powertrain control software and better machine performance.  A solution for finding patterns was built using engineered features, dimensionality reduction, and unsupervised learning.", "Creating a Contemporary Risk Management System Using Python\n \nEngineering a sophisticated in-house risk management solution for a commercial lending platform doesn't necessarily need to involve millions of lines of low-level code, clunky desktop applications, fancy front-end development, or messy spreadsheets.

One of the main problems in this application is the constant rise of new attacks. This scenario, characterized by the fact that not enough labeled examples are available for the new classes of attacks is hardly addressed by traditional machine learning approaches. New findings on the capabilities of Zero-shot learning (ZSL) approach makes it an interesting solution for this problem because it has the ability to classify instances of unseen classes. This approach has been widely applied to computer vision related tasks but from the best of our knowledge it has not been applied to other kind of problems. ZSL has inherently two stages: the attribute learning and the inference stage. \nBased on scientific Python frameworks such as: Scikit-learn, Scipy and Numpy we developed a framework for the application of ZSL on Network Intrusion Detection. We propose a new algorithm for the attribute learning stage. The idea is to learn new values for the attributes based on decision trees (DT). Our results show that based on the rules extracted from the DT a better distribution for the attribute values can be found. We also propose an experimental setup for the evaluation of ZSL on NID. Then, for the inference stage we propose an instance-based classification algorithm representing the data on the Grassmann manifold and implementing a new distance function to compute the k-Nearest Neighbours. On this stage around of 5 millions of data instances are processed on real time in different batches simulating a real network traffic. \nIn this talk we present our framework implementation details as well as its deployment on a Big Data environment.

In many cases, our partners simply want to look at the data under several predefined lenses. While RStudio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Shiny provides this capability, the growing needs of our business partners led to several large and unwieldy applications. My preference for data munging in Pandas led to the creation of Pyxley. Pyxley provides a set of simple widgets in the spirit of Shiny, allowing me to focus on the data and not the UI. \nI spent a week figuring out a decent way to have Python write JavaScript, wrote a set of wrappers, called it Pyxley, and released it in July of 2015. The amount of interest was overwhelming, especially as someone new to open-source. In this talk, I will focus on what I think has and hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worked for Pyxley.

Engineers want stable, testable, high code-quality codebases. Data Scientists want flexibility and sandbox environments to easily test their hypotheses. These differences can exacerbate the already difficult inter-team dynamics involved in building a joint product. While working for the first time as a cross-functional team to build a data application, we had to deal with the following issues:\n\n\nHow much documentation should the data scientists provide the engineers about the model\n\n\nReconciling differing interpretations of business logic between teams\n\n\nReimplementing code from IPython notebooks into an abstracted, object-oriented application\n\n\nPredicting future usage of the application given only the current use case \n\n\nHow to allow the data team to easily experiment and directly reimplement functionality without necessarily going through the full engineering code review process \n\n\nThis talk will discuss how those problems arose and how the data science and engineering teams solved them while creating a new application. \n \nOn our first data science project at Shiftgig, the data science and engineering teams had to build software that was production-ready while maintaining the flexibility of a data science sandbox.

", "AutoDocish: Automated-ish Dataset Documentation\n \nThe creation of dataset documentation is often left to an authoring researcher.  Documentation is vital for the future reusability of a dataset, and yet this time consuming process yields very little immediate impact.  Arguments can be made that well documented datasets are more reusable and can generate better citation metrics in the long term, but it still takes cognitive and workload energy away from the core short-term research mission.  Deconstructing the documentation process tells us that much of the content can be derived from data profiling tools, which can be automated.  This means that the remaining work is simply explaining the context of the data and the meaning of certain values.  AutoDocish is a prototype tool based in Python to assist anyone needing to create data documentation with a base template that includes basic profiles over each column of data and places for authors to provide meanings and explanations for each.  AutoDocish is a command line Python tool written with a framework for expansion, with areas researchers can easily add their own custom functions for specific types of data profiles and calculations.  The output is in basic markdown, meaning that it can easily be added to a website or included as a readable plain text file within a dataset deposit. \n \nAutoDocish is a command line Python tool to semi-automate the dataset documentation process.

All genotype-phenotype studies ask \"Given this textual genome, will a some trait be observed?\" and can be viewed from the lens of a text classification problem. Predicted traits can be anything observable in the organism such as their hair color or whether they will be likely to have cancer. In this talk, I demonstrate the process for constructing a genotype-phenotype machine learning pipeline which predicts resistance to certain pharmaceuticals in Neisseria.

It is complementary to existing relational and time-series databases and key-value stores.\nWhat makes TrailDB different is immutability: Immutable data enables deeper compression, scalability, and architectural decisions, which would not be feasible with existing databases. This is especially true for cloud environments with object stores like Amazon S3 that are a perfect match for compressed, immutable files.\nDeveloper productivity is another main motivation of TrailDB. Individual files are easy to manipulate using standard filesystem tools. The easily portable C library has only a few easily available dependencies, making it easily deployable. The API is clean and minimal by design. Language bindings are provided for Python, Go, Haskell, R, and D.\nTrailDB is a perfect match for use cases that involve detecting patterns over time, such as web/mobile analytics, anomaly detection, and various machine learning models.

With the significant improvement in image processing speeds and availability of large storage systems, the development of methods to query and retrieve images is fundamental to simple human activities like cataloguing and complex research such as synthesizing materials. Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) systems use computer vision techniques to describe images in terms of its properties in order to search similar samples given an image itself as a query, instead of keywords. For this reason, the system works independently of annotations, which can be time consuming and impossible in some scenarios, e.g. high-throughput imaging instruments.\nWhile much work in CBIR has targeted ads and recommendation systems, our pyCBIR allows general purpose investigation across image domains and experiments. Also, pyCBIR contains different distance metrics, and several feature extraction techniques, including a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).\nProposed Methodology\nWe proposed a CBIR tool using python program language called pyCBIR. This tool is composed by six feature extraction methods and ten distances (see Figure 1). Searches occur based on a single image (or a set of images) as query, then pyCBIR retrieves and rank the most similar images according to the user selected parameters.\n\nFigure 1. Flowchart of the proposed methodology: https://vis.lbl.gov/~daniela/2016/pyData/cbir.png\nRegarding the feature extraction methods in Figure 2, pyCBIR calculates the following sets of attributes: Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), First Order Texture Features (FOTF), Local Binary Pattern (LBP). We also implemented two CNN-based schemes for image characterization. The first scheme uses a CNN without the last layer (classification layer), retaining the convolution results as features - this is a common approach among new CBIR systems. The second scheme proposes the use of the class probabilities as descriptor, an original contribution of our work, which also achieved competitive results in comparison to the other feature extraction methods - we call this scheme CNN with probabilities or CNNp. For example, let DB be a database with 5 classes, the CNNp will return 5 probabilities for each DB image, which will be the DB feature vectors. For each retrieval image (RI), we will use the trained CNNp to compute the RI probability. Next, we can compute  different distances, as listed in Figure 2, between feature vectors and return the most similar. \n\nFigure 2. Graphic interface: https://vis.lbl.gov/~daniela/2016/pyData/pyCBIR.png\nExperiments\nWe carried out several experiments using classical image databases for CBIR problems, such as: CIFAR-10, Describable Textures Dataset (DTD) and MNIST, as well as scientific datasets containing microscopic images. Current experiments pointed out that descriptors like HOG and LBP are very sensitive to the parameters choice, and the absence of parameters that work well in all databases. The proposed CNN scheme for feature extraction, CNNq, requires only two parameters: number of epochs and learning rate. These parameters showed less sensitivity, as we illustrated in Figure 3 and 4.      \n\nFigure 3. pyCBIR results for public dataset (DTD): https://vis.lbl.gov/~daniela/2016/pyData/textureDTD.png\n\nFigure 4. pyCBIR results for dataset of microscopic images: https://vis.lbl.gov/~daniela/2016/pyData/fiberMicroscopy.png\n \npyCBIR is a new python tool for content-based image retrieval (CBIR) capable of searching relevant items in large databases, given unseen samples.

Also, pyCBIR contains ten distance metrics, and six bags of features, including a Convolutional Neural Network.", "Time Series for Python with PyFlux\n \nThis talk will introduce the PyFlux library for time series analysis in Python.

Every year, we take a vaccine to possibly gain immunity from that year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s flu. However, the vaccines may not always work. In recent years, people have made attempts at predicting how the influenza virus has changed. For example, every year, world health officials try to predict what drugs to include in the coming year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vaccine. However, many of the methods used have been called \u00e2\u0080\u009cquestionable\u00e2\u0080\u009d by the National Institutes of Medicine.  So, my goal in this project was to come up with a better way for scientists to make flu vaccines.\nIn my talk, I will show how I used Python to implement my flu prediction algorithm, as well as how I used libraries to make my algorithm more efficient and simpler in every step. \nTo create my algorithm, I first had to obtain the genetic sequences of the flu from the flu database. These were in a FASTA file format. I originally read the file in as a simple .txt file, but using the Biopython library to read the genetic sequences, which are over 1700 base pairs long, was much easier and had built-in functions to quickly parse FASTA files. \nNext, I used a variety of machine learning algorithms.

We show how to build a generic deep learning model, which could be used with \u00e2\u0080\u0093 \n1.  A fluorescein angiographic eye image to predict Diabetic Retinopathy\n2.  A fashion image to predict the clothing type in that image\nWe propose a method to apply a pre-trained deep convolution neural network (DCNN) on images to improve prediction accuracy. We use an ImageNet pre-trained DCNN and apply fine-tuning to transfer the learned features to the prediction. We use this fine-tuned model on two very different domain specific datasets. Our approach improves prediction accuracy on both domain-specific datasets, compared to state-of-the-art Machine Learning approaches.\nTALK OUTLINE:\n1.  Brief introduction to Deep Learning\n2.  Motivation behind using Deep Learning models for Images:\nMuch work has been done in developing state-of -the-art machine learning algorithms and morphological image processing techniques, that explicitly extract features prevalent in images. The generic workflow used in a standard image classification technique is as follows:\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2   Image preprocessing techniques for noise removal and contrast enhancement. \n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2   Feature extraction technique\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2   Classification/Prediction\nHowever, these explicit feature extraction processes are very time and effort consuming. Further improvements in prediction accuracy require large quantities of labeled data. Image processing and feature extraction of image dataset is very complex and time-consuming. Thus, we choose to automate the image processing and feature extraction step by using DCNNs. \n3.  Transfer Learning & Fine-tuning DCNNs:\nCurrent trends in the research have demonstrated that DCNNs are very effective in automatically analyzing large collections of images and identifying features that can categorize images with minimum error. DCNNs are rarely trained from scratch, as it is relatively uncommon to have a domain-specific dataset of sufficient size. Since modern DCNNs take 2-3 weeks to train across GPUs, Berkley Vision and Learning Center (BVLC) have released some final DCNN checkpoints. In this work, we use an ImageNet pre-trained DCNN - GoogLeNet. GoogLeNet, which was developed at Google, won the ImageNet challenge in 2014, setting the record for the best contemporaneous results. Motivations for this model were a simultaneously deeper as well as computationally inexpensive architecture.\n4.  Deep Learning models for Image Classification:\nDiabetic retinopathy (DR) eye disease is a common cause of vision loss. Screening diabetic patients based on the diabetic retinopathy symptoms in fluorescein angiography (FA) images can potentially reduce the risk of blindness. Data was drawn from a dataset maintained by EyePacs, and provided via Kaggle. The dataset is composed of multiple, smaller datasets of fundus photographs drawn from various sources. We fine-tune the pre-trained generic DCNN to recognize fluorescein angiography images of eyes and improve DR prediction. Our approach is an end-to-end learning strategy, with minimum assumptions about the contents of images. We show that our approach improves DR prediction accuracy upon the results produced by the Support Vector Machine Approach.\n5.  Deep learning model for Image Tag Prediction:\nGiven the role of clothing apparel in society, fashion classification has many applications. We will focus on optimizing fashion classification for the purposes of annotating images and predicting clothing tags for the fashion images. In this work, we apply a pre-trained Convolutional Network (CNN) and Long short-term memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) on Apparel Classification with Style (ACS) images to improve Fashion Image Tag (FIT) prediction. We combine DCNN for fashion image classification with recurrent neural networks (RNN) for sequence modeling, to create a single network that generates clothing tags for images. We fine-tune the same ImageNet pre-trained GoogLeNet model to extract ACS image features. These CNN-features are in turn used as input to the LSTM RNN model to generate tags for images. The RNN is trained in the context of this single \u00e2\u0080\u009cend-to-end\u00e2\u0080\u009d network. Our approach improves FIT prediction accuracy compared to state-of-the-art approaches.\n6.  For this work, we have used all open source software \u00e2\u0080\u0093 \nI.  Theano/Lasagne:\nTheano is a software package which allows us to write symbolic code and compiles it onto different architectures (in particular, CPU and GPU). It is a Python library that allows us to define, optimize, and evaluate mathematical expressions involving multi-dimensional arrays efficiently. It was developed by machine learning researchers at the University of Montreal. Theano is efficient for deep learning of data. Lasagne is a lightweight library to build and train neural networks in Theano.\nII. Pre-trained model weights:\nMany researchers and engineers have made Caffe models for different tasks with various DCNN architectures and data. These models are learned and applied for problems ranging from simple regression, to large-scale visual classification, to speech and robotics applications. Several pre-trained model weights are shared by Berkeley Vision and Learning Center (BVLC) via the model zoo framework. Lasagne has implementations for both ImageNet-trained VGG with 16-layers and ImageNet-trained GoogLeNet. The weights for both these models are stored as pickle files. We leverage these pre-trained models for DR prediction, using them as initial weights for fine-tuning the models.\nIII.    GPU, CUDA and cuDNN:\nTraditional machine learning uses handwritten feature extraction and modality-specific machine learning algorithms to label images or recognize voices. However, this method is computationally very expensive. Advanced deep neural networks use algorithms, big data, and the computational power of the graphics processing units (GPUs) to change this dynamic. CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is a parallel computing platform and programming model created by NVIDIA and implemented by the GPUs that they produce.\nThe NVIDIA CUDA Deep Neural Network library (cuDNN) is a GPU-accelerated library of primitives for deep neural networks. cuDNN provides highly tuned implementations for standard routines such as forward and backward convolution, pooling, normalization, and activation layers.\nHere, we use one NVIDIA Quadro K1200 GPU, CUDA 7.5 and cuDNN 5.\n7.  Outcome: \nWe show how deep learning out performs state-of-the art image prediction techniques. Below is our prediction accuracy chart for each model -\n1.  Medical-Image-Classification-Model\na.  Feature-based SVM Accuracy - 0.66\nb.  Our fine-tuned GoogLeNet DCNN Accuracy - 0.79\n2.  Fashion-Image-Classification-Model\na.  Feature-based SVM Accuracy - 0.72\nb.

While the algorithms may sometimes be unique and complex, the rest of the code is often simple and routine. Sometimes mathematical models developed by teams of developers over time become difficult to update because there is no framework for how new data, calculations and outputs are integrated into the existing models. Carousel allows developers to focus on creating complex mathematical models that are robust and easy to maintain by abstracting generic routines and establishing a simple but extensible framework.\nThe Framework\nA Carousel basic model consists of 5 built in layers:\n\nData\nFormulas\nCalculations\nSimulations\nOutputs\n\nLayers\nCarousel is extensible by creating more advanced models and layers. A Carousel model is a collection of layers. Carousel layers share a common base class. Each layer also has a corresponding object and a registry where objects are stored. All layers have a load method that loads all of the layer objects specified into the model. When a model is loaded it loads the objects specified for each layer.\nExample\nConsider a load shifting algorithm for residential or commercial rooftop solar power. The model might have a performance calculation, a load calculation, a cost calculation and an optimization algorithm that determines how home or business appliances are operated to minimize overall yearly cost of the system.\nThe performance calculation contains several formulas which require input data from an internal database of solar panel parameters and an online API of weather conditions, so the user creates a data source and reader for each of these. There are some data readers already included in Carousel and once a data reader is created it can be reused in many different projects. Maybe the user submits a pull request to Carousel to add the new API and database reader. The load calculation contains formulas for how the appliances are used. The input data for the appliances are entered into a generic worksheet so the user creates a data source for appliances and uses the XLRDReader to collect the data for each appliance from their worksheets.\nThe user organizes the formulas into 4 modules, that correspond to each of the calculations, but some formulas are reused since they are generic. For example, data frame summation formulas are used with different time series to create daily, monthly and annual outputs. The user maps out the calculations and specifies their interdependence to other formulas. For example, the cost calculation depends on the load and performance calculations and the optimization algorithm depends on the cost.\nThe user specifies each output name, initial value and other attributes. Specifications for each layer can be in a JSON parameter file or directly in the code as class attributes; Carousel will interpret either at runtime when it creates the model. Finally the user creates a simulation which in this case is unique because instead of marching through time or space, the simulation iterates over potential load shifting solutions from the algorithm. The user decides which data or outputs to log during the simulation and which to save in reports. Now that the model is created, the user loads the model and sends it the \"start\" command. After the simulation is complete, the user can examine the outputs and their variances. The outputs will have been automatically converted to the units specified in the model.\nData Layer\nThe data layer handles all inputs to the models. The data layer object is a data source. Each data source has a data reader. A data source is a document, API, database or other place from which input data for the model can be obtained. The data source and reader provide a framework for specifying how data is acquired. For example a data source for stock market prices might be a public API. An implementation of the stock market API data source specifies the names and attributes of each input data that will be read from the API and how the data reader should read them. The data source is similar to a deserializer because it describes how the data from the source should be interpreted by the model and creates an object in the data registry.\nFormula Layer\nThe formula layer handles operations on input data that generate new outputs. It differs from the calculation layer which handles how formulas are combined together. The formula layer object is a formula, and each formula has a formula importer. For example the Python formula importer can import formulas that are written as Python functions.\nCalculation Layer\nCalculations are combinations of formulas. Each calculation also has a map of what data and output are used as arguments and what outputs the return values will be. Calculations also implement calculators. Currently there is a static calculator and a dynamic calculator, but new calculators can be implemented that can be reused in other models. The calculation also implements indexing into data and output registries in order retrieve items by index or at a specific time.\nOutput Layer\nOutputs are just like data except they don't need a reader because they are only generated from calculations. Each output is like a serializer because it determines how output objects will be reported or displayed to the user.\nSimulation Layer\nThe simulation layer determines the order of calculations based on the calculation dependencies. It first executes all of the static calculations and then loops over dynamic calculations, displaying logs and saving periodic reports as specified.\nModel\nThe model is a low level class that can be extended to add new layers or implement new simulation commands. Currently only the basic model is implemented. A new model might contain a post processing layer that generates plots and reports from outputs.\nRegistry\nEvery layer has a dictionary called a registry that contains all of the layer objects and metadata corresponding to the layer attributes. The registry implements a register method that doesn't allow an item to registered more than once. Each layer registry is subclassed from the base registry so that specific layer attributes can be associated to each key. For example, data sources and outputs have a variance attribute while formulas have an args attribute.\nRunning Model Simulations\nAfter a model has been described using the framework, it can be loaded. Then any or all of the model simulations can be executed from the model. The simulation specifies commands to the model that user sends using the models command method. Currently the basic model can execute the simulation start command.\nUnits and Uncertainty\nCarousel uses the Pint units wrapper to convert units as specified. Uncertainty is propagated using the UncertaintyWrapper package which was developed for Carousel. It can wrap Python extensions and non-linear algorithms without changing any code. It propagates covariance and sensitivity across all formulas. \nFuture Work\nA basic version of Carousel is ready now. There is an example of a photovoltaic module performance model in the documentation online at GitHub. Some ideas for new features are listed in the Carousel wiki on GitHub.\n\nData validation\nReuse 3rd party serializer/deserializer for data layer\nModel integrity check\nDatabase data reader\nREST API data reader\nOnline repository to share data readers, simualtions, formulas and layers\nAutomatic solver selection\nPost processing layer\nTesting tools\nConcurrency and speedups\nRemote process and Carousel client\n\nSource, Docs, Issues and Wiki\n\nCarousel\nUncertaintyWrapper\n\nPrevious Presentations\nCarousel was presented at the 5th Sandia PVPMC Workshop hosted by EPRI in Santa Clara in May 2016\nAcknowledgement\nCarousel and UncertaintyWrapper were developed with the support of SunPower Corp. They are distributed with a BSD 3-clause license.\n \nCarousel is an extensible framework for mathematical models that handles generic routines such as loading and saving data, generating reports, converting units, propagating uncertainty and running simulations so developers can focus on creating complex algorithms that are easy to share and maintain.", "Virtual Laboratories: Vision for an Earth Sciences Collaborative And Distributed Environment\n \nVirtual Laboratories: Vision for an Earth Sciences Collaborative And Distributed Environment\nAbstract\nWith the advent of IPCC reports, Earth Sciences in general, and Climate Sciences in particular, have become an invaluable tool for policy makers.

This mainly involves supervised learning where we learn from historic data. The predicted observations usually gives a probability score which measures randomness. We believe there are situations where along with randomness we need some fuzziness to give some confidence to the observation. \nFuzziness and randomness are two very different concepts. We say that fuzziness occurs when there is no boundary between outcomes. And we commonly refer to randomness as the uncertainty associated with effective variability from alternative outputs. \nAlthough different, it is simple to provide real world scenarios where randomness and fuzziness work together. One example is in the stock market where there are no historical similarities to use in modeling such as new high patterns. Here, we say that there are no defined boundaries that forecast event probabilities in the next few days. Another example is in the emergency room where the early detection algorithm gives a risk score, but the environmental factors impacting the patient are not predictable. In both of these examples, we can fairly easily model the randomness, but there is a fuzziness that needs to be dealt with also. We will discuss a model we are researching that improves our predictability of that fuzziness and randomness.\n    The heart of this improvement lies in how we approach variability. Variability of alternative outputs can describe randomness and is easily modeled using regression or other predictive analytic methods. Using fuzziness, a second source of variability can be individualized (per observation) in the vagueness with which the attributes are selected. This type of uncertainty is due to variety of environmental factors depending on the use case. For the stock market, uncertainty is due to a set of economic conditions and policy reforms that have not been looked at before, while for an emergency room scenario it might be due to variety of scenarios before the patient was hospitalized.\n    Research recommends several different approaches to simulate the choice behavior in different choice contexts. Our focus is on designing choice models that can take into account one of two sources of uncertainty.\n    In this talk we will discuss the following:\n\nMotivation of combining fuzziness and predictability.\nMath behind Dempster Shaffer method.\nOur Analysis combining Logistic Regression with Dempster Shaffer.\nReview of our results and interpretation.\n\n \nCurrent main stream data science work is mainly focused on prediction , segmentation  and data analysis.  This mainly involves supervised learning where we learn from historic data. The predicted observations usually gives a probability score which measures randomness. We believe there are situations where along with randomness we need some fuzziness to give some confidence to the observation. ", "Keynote: Working Efficiently with Big Data in Text Formats\n \nIn an ideal world, all our large datasets would live in well optimized storage formats, such as RDBMS's, key-value NoSQL stores, HDF5 hierarchical datasets, or other formats that are well typed and fast to access.  In our actual world, a great deal of our data lives in CSV, flat-file, or JSON formats, roughly stored on file systems, with little typing of data values.  Moreover, data in these formats often have variably sized records making seeking data a linear scan operation.\nContinuum Analytics has produced a custom optimized library called IOPro that includes a component called TextAdapter.  TextAdapter provides abstractions to data access into these textual formats that adds much better data typing, minimizes memory use, uses indexing for seeking, and other facilities for better, faster data access without requiring conversion of exploratory datasets into permanent optimized formats.  We will be releasing this code as an Open Source project, and plan on enhancing the library to allow further performance optimizations and integration with the Dask project.\nAs well as looking at technical and performance details of TextAdapter, this talk will discuss the economic and social concerns of company developed and supported Open Source projects. Continuum continues to explore some of these issues through our release of TextAdapter, following on company trajectory of moving projects from proprietary to open source status whenever reasonable.\n \nN/A", "Creating Knowledgebases from unstructured text.\n \nA major part of Big Data collected in most industries is in the form of unstructured text. Some examples are log files in IT sector, analysts reports in the finance sector, patents, laboratory notes and papers, etc. Some of the challenges of gaining insights from unstructred text is converting it into structured information and generating training sets for machine learning. Typically training sets for supervised learning are generated through the process of human annotation. In case of text this involves reading several thousands to million lines of texts by subject matter experts. This is very expensive and may not always be available, hence it is important to solve the problem of generating training sets before attempting to build machine learning models. Our approach is to combine rule based techniques with small amounts of SME time to by pass time consuming manual creation of training data. Once we have a good set of rules mimicking the training data we will use them to create knowledgebases out of the structured data. This knowledgebase can be further queried to gain insight on the domain. I have applied this technique to several domains, such as data from drug labels and medical journals, log data generated through customer interaction, generation of market research reports, etc. I will talk about the results in some of these domains and the advantage of using this approach.\n \nNLP and Machine Learning without training data.", "Mental Models to Use and Avoid as a Data Scientist\n \n\nThe first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool. -- Richard Feynman\n\nA scientific mindset is a powerful force for producing knowledge: from academic fields, to business and public policy. The combination of statistical rigor, an experimental mindset and the drive to ask the right questions produces crucial input to decision making.\nWe will illustrate several principles of scientific thinking that should be more widespread. Each principle will be demonstrated with a specific example that will help it stick with the audience after they leave. \nA few key principles, attitudes, and techniques for Data Science:\n\n\"I am easy to fool\" -- acknowledge confirmation and experimenter bias\n\"Everyone knows what it takes to change my mind\" -- culture of critical thinking, avoid congruence bias (test alternative hypotheses)\n\"A good explanation can be proven wrong\" -- falsifiability\n\"The strength of my belief is proportional to the strength of the evidence\" -- degrees of plausibility\nBlinding analyses -- not letting expectation of result drive model revision\nAnswering the question: what would it look like if your hypothesis were wrong for a hypothetical case?\n\nMindsets to avoid:\n\nJust-so storytelling is a tempting anti-pattern -- creating story to explain the data after knowing the answer.\n\"The correct explanation must be easy for me to understand\" -- availability or belief bias.\n\n \nUsing Jupyter Notebooks and Python code, we will present several data-driven examples of some simple, powerful, yet relatively uncommon, ways of thinking as a good Data Scientist. We will also warn about a few dangerous ways of thinking to avoid. Our Jupyter Notebooks and slides will be made freely available after the talk.", "Altair: Declarative, Statistical Visualization for Python\n \nAltair provides a Python API for building statistical visualizations in a declarative manner. By statistical visualization we mean:\n\nThe data source is a DataFrame that consists of columns of different data types (quantitative, ordinal, nominal and date/time).\nThe DataFrame is in a tidy format where the rows correspond to samples and the columns correspond the observed variables.\nThe data is mapped to the visual properties (position, color, size, shape, faceting, etc.) using the group-by operation of Pandas and SQL.\n\nThe Altair API contains no actual visualization rendering code but instead emits JSON data structures following the Vega-Lite specification. For convenience, Altair can optionally use ipyvega to display client-side renderings seamlessly in the Jupyter notebook.\nAltair has the following features:\n\nCarefully-designed, declarative Python API based on traitlets.\nAuto-generated internal Python API that guarantees visualizations are type-checked and in full conformance with the Vega-Lite specification.\nAuto-generate Altair Python code from a Vega-Lite JSON spec.\nDisplay visualizations in the live Jupyter Notebook, on GitHub and nbviewer.\nExport visualizations to PNG images, stand-alone HTML pages and the Online Vega-Lite Editor.\nSerialize visualizations as JSON files.\nExplore Altair with 40 example datasets and over 70 examples.\n\nAltair is developed by Brian Granger and Jake Vanderplas in close collaboration with the UW Interactive Data Lab.\n \nAltair is a declarative statistical visualization library for Python.

The AI generates data-based vocabularies used in \u00e2\u0080\u0098similarity\u00e2\u0080\u0099 search - allowing a one-click lookup of semantically related words that would otherwise be missed by the user. Preliminary results show that \u00e2\u0080\u0098similarity\u00e2\u0080\u0099 search outperforms the traditional keyword-Boolean patent search.", "Visualizing Geographic Data With Python\n \nMaps have been such a mainstay of our lives for so long now that it's hard to imagine just how complex it is to create one. Keep in mind though, the earth is a 3-dimensional spherical object, so we're stuck with the problem of \"projecting\" the world onto a 2-dimensional surface. What this means is that every map you've ever looked at was wrong in some way.\nIn this talk, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll discuss what a map projection is, and why the Mercator projection, the map you use everyday, is both incorrect and unfair, but useful nonetheless. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll also see some ways that we can create maps using Python. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll first see how to create data-rich maps using the matplotlib library with the basemap toolkit. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll then see how to create maps for the web using libraries like Folium, the python interface to Leaflet.js.\nBy the end of this talk, you should have a general understanding of the problems surrounding the creation of effective maps. You should also feel comfortable picking out a proper map projection and plotting data on it using a multitude of techniques and the Python language.\n \nThe statistician George Box once wrote that \u00e2\u0080\u009call models are wrong, but some are useful\u00e2\u0080\u009d; the same could be said for maps. In this talk, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll discuss the problems that arise when creating 2-dimensional representations of our world. We'll then see how to create data-rich maps using Python, matplotlib, and the basemap toolkit. we'll also see how to create maps for the web using the Folium library.", "Applying machine learning to software development to reduce bugs\n \nSoftware development is in a historical transition from a stage of organized craftsmanship to a stage of industrial production of software.  As a part of this transition machines are doing more and more of the repetitive work freeing humans to do the creative work and decision making.  However we are behind in the ability to extract risk signals from development artifacts of large projects.  We are not getting better at reducing project failures.\nWe can use machine learning applied to the development process to improve outcomes.\nThis talk shows how change history and issue tracking data can be correlated to identify areas of risk concentration in the project.  Simultaneously some statistical results show us areas where conventional methods may be wasting effort and areas where these may be ignoring risk.  \nDemo uses example code and artifacts from Apache projects, and scikit-learn with Jupyter notebook.\n \nThis talk shows how we can reduce risk of failure in software development by using machine learning.  Using example code and artifacts from Apache projects, and scikit-learn with Jupyter notebook,  we show how to identify areas of risk in large codelines.

In an effort to understand the space, these teams have begun to play with their data and create early prototypes. Unfortunately, those prototypes primarily end up in powerpoint and die. Of the ones that move forward, there is a gap in knowledge of their development team in how to release to production. \nFrom our experience, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen their data science and development team do not speak a common language. At Pivotal Labs, we found a good way to overcome this language problem. Our solution is to follow an API first approach which is one of our core principles.\nIn this talk, I want to to share my experiences of how to put these models into production. I will focus on the tools that we use for this and what data science has to do with microservices. My presentation will contain an end-to-end data science example.\n \nThis talk discusses one of Pivotal Labs\u00e2\u0080\u0099 core principles, API first, and how this can help to overcome the common language problem between data scientists and software engineers.

We propose a method that makes removal and editing of soft shadows easy. Soft shadows are ubiquitous, but remain notoriously difficult to extract and manipulate. We posit that soft shadows can be segmented, and therefore edited, by learning a mapping function for image patches that generates shadow mattes. We validate this premise by removing soft shadows from photographs with only a small amount of user input.\nGiven only broad user brush strokes that indicate the region to be processed, our new supervised regression algorithm automatically unshadows an image, removing the umbra and penumbra. The resulting lit image is frequently perceived as a believable shadow-free version of the scene. We tested the approach on a large set of soft shadow images, and performed a user study that compared our method to the state of the art and to real lit scenes. Our results are more difficult to identify as being altered, and are perceived as preferable compared to prior work.\n \nFind out how we used recent advances in photorealistic rendering and machine learning to teach a Random Forest how soft shadows look like. See how this model can then be used to to remove and modify shadows in RGB photographs with minimal user input.", "Data Wrangling with Python\n \nOverview\nIn this tutorial, we'll be taking an exploratory look at how to perform data wrangling using Python.

It supports tasks like fitting, evaluating, storing, distributing, and updating (predictive) models. Core machine learning processes are compatible with the open source machine learning library scikit-learn and thus, a large number of scikit-learn\u00e2\u0080\u0099s features can be used with Palladium. Although being implemented in Python, Palladium provides support for other languages and is shipped with examples how to integrate and expose R and Julia models. For an efficient deployment of services based on Palladium, a script to create Docker images automatically is provided. This talk will cover the use of Palladium including an example where a simple classification service is set up.

We needed a way, given some target image, to find similar images downloaded by our web-crawler (think Tineye).\nSo not only did we need to support fast, accurate lookup for millions or even billions of images, we also needed to facilitate very high volume insertion -- around 10k images per second.\nIn my talk, I will cover:\n\nThe Problem: why is finding similar images hard?\nAlgorithm: based on this paper\nPerformance: but does it scale?\nAlternatives\n\n \nThe goal was not only to support high write volumes ( >10k/s) but also to support fast lookup of similar images (around 1-2s for over 1B images).

They can also buy products and create feeds of preferred brands and categories of items.\nWe have large amounts of data generated by the users when they scroll and search through products and we use it to understand the user. We want to give everyone meaningful recommendations on the items they might like, hence tailoring the experience to who they are.  We build pseudo-intelligent algorithms capable of extracting the style profile of a user and we crunch products data to match items to the user based on a classification model. The model is validated and statistical analyses are performed to determine the tipping point when recommendations are valuable to the user. \nThe talk will go through the steps we implement by showing how the full data stack of Python is used in achieving this goal and how it is interfaced with a Spark cluster through PySpark in order to run Machine Learning algorithms on big data.\n \nPredicting what people like when they choose what to wear is a non-trivial task involving several ingredients.

Big data approaches are powerful, but  complex to set up and to maintain. In a test setup we tried a compromise of both: What happens if you glue more than 1000 single SQL databases into a huge cluster?\nThanks to access to an unused IaaS cluster, we had the opportunity to research the behavior of many nodes clustered together. Data loading becomes a real challenge, while maintenance and monitoring such a drove of containers was no longer possible manually. We investigated the effect of changing container-vm-ratios.

However, most Python libraries require the data to be extracted from the database to working memory and resources are limited by computational power and memory. Analyzing a large amount of data is often impractical or even impossible. Ibmdbpy is an open-source Python package, developed by IBM, which provides a Python interface for data manipulation and machine learning algorithms such as Kmeans or Linear Regression to make working with databases more efficient by seamlessly pushing operations into the underlying database for execution. This does not only lift the memory limit of Python, but also allows users to profit from performance-enhancing features of the database management system. Ibmdbpy is designed for IBM DB2 and IBM dashDB, a database system available on IBM BlueMix, the IBM cloud application development and analytics platform. Via remote connection, user operations can benefit from in-database specific features, such as columnar technology and parallel processing, without having to interact with the database explicitly. Some in-database functions additionally use lazy loading to load only parts of the data that are actually required to further increase efficiency. Keeping the data in the database also avoids security issues that are associated with extracting data and ensures that the data that is being analyzed is as current as possible. Ibmdbpy can be used by Python developers with very little additional knowledge, since it imitates the well-known interface of Pandas library for data manipulation and Scikit-learn library for machine learning algorithms. Ibmdbpy provides a great runtime advantage for operations on medium to large dataset, i.e. on tables that have 1 million rows or more. Providing a Python interface for databases allows to bridge the gap between data warehousing platform and end-user environment, so that developers can benefit both from the expressivity of Python and from the speed-up provided by SQL execution in the database, which can be run on a cluster. In this talk, we will show the advantages of such approach for scaling Python analytics and do a short demo of data analysis with ibmdbpy.\n \nPython Analytics can be accelerated using SQL- Pushdowns to benefit from in-database performance-enhancing features such as column-stores and parallel processing.

Instead of focussing on the search logs and by analysing queries with the help of machine learning models such as LSTM, it is possible to get a very decent model to classify the search queries. \nThis talk focuses majorly on LSTMs and their usefulness when it comes to search query classification. We also discuss how we can accurately classify search queries in hundreds of categories using open source data available online and how this can be combined with LSTMs to provide a much stable and better result.\n \nThis talk discusses how machine learning/data mining techniques can be applied to classify search terms that people use in search engines like Google, Bing, Yahoo etc. The talk focuses on machine learning techniques such as LSTM (long short term memory) rather than traditional ways like analysing user-behaviour with the help of their search logs. ", "Python and TouchDesigner for Interactive Experiments\n \nTouchDesigner is a visual programming software made by a company called Deriviative. I use this software with Python to make complex interactive installations which are hybrid of art and science. I use the same technique to make science experiments so the lab can test the validity of neurofeedback paradigms. I want to share some of the techniques I used in our brain driven installation, My Virual Dream, because I think there is huge potential to make very practical and very fantastical things. Quickly.

", "Plumbing in Python: Pipelines for Data Science Applications\n \nThe data flow library presented in this talk provides a thin abstraction layer between data pipeline declarations and specific execution backends. As exceptions are the rule, the library allows the user to introduce limited control flow into pipelines. At the same time, it also offers composability of pipelines, as many of our projects share similar building blocks.\nIn this talk we will show how using this library leads to a more functional style of programming, which improved the speed of our iterations. This shift in development style, already in the early stages of model development, includes clear separation of I/O operations and data transformations as well as the separation of data flow control and actual computations.

Therefore, many users need to maintain\na library or an application for both major Python versions.\nThere are several strategies to support Python 2 and 3.\nSince maintaining two separate versions is not a real option,\ntwo major strategies have been established:\n1.) automatic translation via 2to3 or\n2.) the single-source approach with or without the help of an\n    external library\nIn the beginning, it was though that the users will swiftly move to Python 3.\nThis implies a one-time effort to port your Python 2 code to Python 3.\nAs it turned out, this use case not as common as expected.\nTherefore, the automatic translation approach was moved into the install step.\nThis technique is somewhat problematic because the translation is done\nat the time the user installs a library on th user's machine.\nOver time the single-source approach became much more viable option.\nThis tutorial focuses on this approach.\nOutline\n\n\nOverview of important Python 2/3 differences\n\nprint function\niterators everywhere\nno apple-orange comparisons\nintegers without limits\nstrings are always unicode\nnew syntax\nre-structuring of the standard library\nbuild-in functions\n\n\n\nKeep your tests ready\n\n\nWriting your own compatibility layer\n\nuse modern Python 2 (exceptions, next)\nfuture\nversion testing\nre-defining built-ins\nstandard lib packports\nhandling strings and bytes\nIO\n\n\n\nUsing python-future.org\n\nstaring from scratch\nstarting from Python 2\nstarting from Python 3\ncatching exceptions\nautomatic conversion\nporting philosophy\n\n\n\nRequirements\nYou should have Python 2.7 and Python 3.5 installed.\nPlease install https://python-future.org:\nconda install future\n\nor\n\npip install future\n\n \nUsing a single source code to support Python 2 and Python 3 is a useful\nstrategy to maintain backward compatibility and support the newest\nversion of Python at the same time. This tutorial gives an overview\nover the major differences between Python 2 and 3.\nBased on these difference, two approaches are introduced.\nThe creation on your own compatibility library is the first method.\nIt has the advantage that there is no extra dependency.\nThe disadvantage of this approach is that it you need to\ndive deep into the topic and that it can become a substantial effort.\nThe second approach is to use an existing library.\nThis tutorial  introduces python-future.org that makes many\nPython 3 features work in Python 2", "BigchainDB : a Scalable Blockchain Database, in Python \n \nThis talk describes BigchainDB. BigchainDB fills a gap in the decentralization ecosystem: a decentralized database, at scale. It points to performance of 1 million writes per second throughput, storing petabytes of data, and sub-second latency.\nThe BigchainDB design starts with a distributed database (DB), and through a set of innovations adds blockchain characteristics: decentralized control, immutability, and creation & movement of digital assets. BigchainDB inherits characteristics of modern distributed databases: linear scaling in throughput and capacity with the number of nodes, a full-featured NoSQL query language, efficient querying, and permissioning. Being built on an existing distributed DB, it also inherits enterprise-hardened code for most of its codebase.\nScalable capacity means that legally binding con- tracts and certificates may be stored directly on the blockchain database. The permissioning system enables configurations ranging from private enterprise blockchain databases to open, public blockchain databases. BigchainDB is complementary to decentralized processing platforms like Ethereum, and decentralized file systems like InterPlanetary File System (IPFS).\nThis talk describes technology perspectives that led to the BigchainDB design: traditional blockchains, distributed databases, and a case study of the domain name system (DNS). We introduce a concept called blockchain pipelining, which is key to scalability when adding blockchainlike characteristics to the distributed DB. We present a thorough description of BigchainDB, a detailed analysis of latency, and experimental results. The talk concludes with a description of use cases.\n \nThis talk describes BigchainDB.

However, Python was originally designed for scripting tasks, using dynamic types and widescale object orientation, neither of which features are necessarily beneficial when it comes to numerical computing. Thus, we have seen the widespread use of Python libraries for numerical computation (scipy, numpy, etc.).\nJulia is a new language, developed at MIT, which attempts to learn from the experience of development of Python and similar languages. The main goals are to provide a non-verbose, performance oriented language written from the ground-up to support numerical processing and parallelisation. In its most basic syntax Julia resembles a cross between Matlab and Python, but via compilation through an intermediate level representation (llvm) it offers performance which is comparable to compiled C-code.\nI am not going to argue that Julia is ready for primetime yet. However, it is definitely worth consideration by anyone currently resorting to cython or needing distributed access to large datasets. \nI will present an outline/introduction to the language, including the main benefits and current weaknesses. Of particular interest to the audience may be the fact that Python libraries are importable and callable from within Julia, allowing a continuity of existing workflow but from a Julia-based host environment.

", "Using Spark -- With PySpark\n \nSpark is one of the most popular Big Data frameworks. It is a great choice when you need to scale up your \ndata science jobs. It is written in Java/Scala but also supports other languages like R and Python. \nPySpark is the API to use Spark from Python. With Spark DataFrames the overhead of calling Spark from Python is claimed to be near zero compared to Java/Scala.

Are you interested already? \nIn this tutorial we show you how to get started with Spark. We provide a small cluster for you so that we don't loose time with installing servers. Then we use some publicly available data set and show you how to use this data in Spark. We will use machine learning algorithms to analyze the data and make predictions. Results will be visualized in the notebooks. You will be able to see what performance difference it makes when you run your code on a cluster instead of a single node.\nParticipants should bring their own laptop with a web browser installed and be able to access Wifi.

We focused on the development of body representations - orientation and movement. This ability has a crucial part in the mammalian sensorimotor and self perception systems. \nIn infants,the process of acquiring body awareness involves active exploration of the sensorimotor space by babbling and self-touch. We tried using similar technics with the Nao humanoid robot. \nUsing an artificial neural network, we believe the robot can develop and maintain a body schema that can also be used for recognizing unexpected situations such as external stimuli or body changes. \nWe used different python tools, both for the activation of the robot and the analysis of the recorded data. Our main tool was Lasagne - a library used for creating feed-forward neural networks and train them using back propagation. \n \nCan artificial childhood improve robot intelligence?

These neutrinos are interesting because the most energetic of\nthem likely hold the key to one of the longest-standing problems in\nastrophysics, the origin of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays.\nCosmic rays were discovered over 100 years ago, and in the mean time we know\nthat they are electrically charged particles (mostly protons) from outer space.\nThe most energetic of them pack the kinetic energy of a rifle bullet into a\nsingle atomic nucleus, well beyond the reach of any particle accelerator that\nwe could ever build on Earth. What we don't know, however, is where or how they\nare accellerated to such energies, because their directions are scrambled by\nintervening magnetic fields. This is where neutrinos enter the picture. They\nare produced in large numbers whenever particles like protons are smashed into\neach other at high energies, something that is bound to happen in the cosmic\naccelerators that produce the cosmic rays we observe at Earth. Neutrinos are,\nhowever, electrically neutral and only interact via the weak force, which makes\nthem extremely difficult to stop. That makes high-energy neutrinos a very\ninteresting way to do astronomy: unlike photons, they can't be absorbed in dust\nclouds and radiation fields, and unlike cosmic rays, they can't be deflected by\nmagnetic fields.\nThe elusiveness of neutrinos is also what makes IceCube data analysis\ninteresting and challenging. The first challenge on the way from raw data to\nscientific result is data preparation: one needs to actually find neutrino\nevents in the data. For every neutrino event, there are millions of events\ncaused by cosmic-ray air showers that penetrate the 1.5 km of ice over the\ndetector. We separate the neutrinos from uninteresting background events using\nthe features of each event. The optimal set of features and the separation\nstrategy depend on the kind of measurement one wants to do, and there are many\ndifferent directions of interest within the 300-strong IceCube Collaboration.\nThis means that the event processing chain and data format need to be extremely\nflexible, allowing physicists with limited software skills to add new features\nto the data. Our data processing framework, called IceTray, represents each\nevent as a frame, essentially a dictionary of string-key pairs. Each frame is\npassed through a series of modules that can add new features of arbitrary\ntype based on the data already in the frame, or drop frames from further\nprocessing. While the core of IceTray and many of its modules are written in\nC++, all the configuration is done in Python, and modules themselves can be\nwritten in Python. This allows for quite rapid and accessible development. The\nserialized form of these frames, called an \"I3\" file, also serves as our\nlong-term archive format.\nOnce a data sample has been prepared, it's time for visualization and analysis.\nHere we move out of our custom world and start using standard tools and data\nformats. We support two analysis universes: one based on\nHDF5, which is convenient to read with\nPyTables, and another based on\nROOT, an analysis framework and associated data format\nspecific to high-energy physics. We write to such \"tabular\" formats using an\ninternal framework called tableio that hammers each object in a frame into a\nseries of table rows. Backends for HDF5 and ROOT then emit these rows in a\nspecific format, along with a description and unit string for each column.\nI will illustrate a typical Python-based analysis using the discovery of the\nfirst high-energy astrophysical\nneutrinos as an\nexample.\n \nTransforming data produced at the IceCube Neutrino Observatory into scientific\nresults presents several interesting challenges. My talk will give an overview\nof our software stack, written in a colorful mix of Python, C++, Java, and\nFORTRAN, present some of our custom solutions, and highlight areas where we use\nstandard libraries and design patterns.", "Usable A/B testing \u00e2\u0080\u0093 A Bayesian approach\n \nWhen it comes to developing a product, most people focus on \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhy\u00e2\u0080\u009d a feature should be implemented.

Getting an unbiased view on what media report on requires an unbiased sample of media content. In many cases it is obvious which political bias an author has. In other cases some expertise is required to judge the political bias of a text. Assistive technology for estimating the political bias of texts can be helpful in this context, especially for scaling things up. We investigated to what extent political party affiliation can be predicted from textual content with basic machine learning tools. We used the text of speeches and discussions in the German parliament as well as texts from party manifestos to train classifiers that predict political party affiliation or political views based on standard text features. Results indicate that automatic classification of political affiliation and political views is possible with well above chance accuracy. We hope that this work will eventually be helpful for unbiased political education in the presence of massive amounts of media content. We show some web applications of how the models can be used in combination with classical topic models to analyse texts for which the party affiliation is not clear, such as news articles. \n \nAn unbiased view on media reports requires understanding the political bias of a text.

In this environment, building an ETL process for data analyses, or integrating data from different services becomes quite challenging. \nPostgreSQL's new logical replication features, however, now make it possible to stream all the data changes from the isolated databases to the data integration system so that it can collect this data, represent it in different forms, and prepare it for analysis. \nIn this talk, I will discuss Zalando's open-source data collection prototype, which uses PostgreSQL's logical replication streaming capabilities to collect data from various PostgreSQL databases, and recreate it for different formats and systems (Data Lake, Operational Data Store, KPI calculation systems, automatic process monitoring). The audience will come away with new ideas for how to use Postgres streaming replication in a microservices environment.\n \nTO BE ADDED", "PySpark in Practice\n \nAt Pivotal Labs we have many data science engagements on big data. Typical problems involve real-time data from sensors collected by telecom operators to GPS data produced by vehicle tracking systems. One widespread framework to solve those inherently difficult problems is Apache Spark. In this talk, we want to share our best practices with PySpark, Spark\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Python API, highlighting our experience as well as dos and don'ts. In particular, we will focus on the whole data science pipeline from data ingestion, data munging and wrangling to the actual model building. \nFinally, many businesses have started to realise that there is no return on investment from data science if the models do not go into production. At Pivotal Labs, one our core principle is API first. Therefore, we will also talk how we put our models into production, sharing our hands-on knowledge in this field and also how this fits into test-driven development.\n \nIn this talk we will share our best practices of using PySpark in numerous customer facing data science engagements. Topics covered in this talk are\n\nConfiguration\nUnit testing with PySpark\nIntegration with SQL on Hadoop engines\nData pipeline management and workflows\nData Structures (RDDs vs. Data Frames vs. Data Sets)\nWhen to use MLlib vs scikit-learn\nOperationalisation\n", "Estimating stock price correlations using Wikipedia\n \n According to Modern Portfolio Theory, assembling a portfolio involves forming expectations about the individual stock's future risk and return as well as future correlations between stock prices. These future correlations are typically estimated using historical stock price data. However, there are situations where this type of data is not available, such as the time preceding an IPO. \n In this talk I look at an alternative to historical correlations as proxy for future correlations: using graph analysis techniques and text similarity measures in order to estimate the correlation between stock prices. \n The focus of the analysis will be on companies listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange which form the DAX. I am going to use Wikipedia articles in order to derive the textual description for each company. Additionally, I will use the Wikipedia category structure to derive a graph describing relations between companies. \n The analysis will be performed using the scikit-learn and networkX libraries and example code will be available to the audience. \n \nBuilding an equities portfolio is a challenging task for a finance professional as it requires, among others, future correlations between stock prices.  As this data is not always available, in this talk I look at an alternative to historical correlations as proxy for future correlations: using graph analysis techniques and text similarity measures based on Wikipedia data. ", "Bridging the gap: from Data Science to service\n \nProviding consulting services or custom machine learning based tools involves many elements beyond choosing the right models, analysis methods and tools. While working at Machinalis, we learned a set of ideas that help us to make our projects successful, which have more to do with the human and engineering side of the service than the science and programming.\nThe goal of the talk is to share that experience with people that are providing or planning to provide services based on data science. It presents some tips and explains how they work and the kind of problems that they avoid. The content of the talk is divided into two main areas:\n\n\nTips related to team collaboration. These include aspects to consider regarding how and what to communicate between different roles in the team (data scientists, developers, project managers, people doing labeling or entry, etc.), and how to make certain decisions that the team faces (choosing tools, knowing when to do a flimsy proof of concept vs when to create robust products using best practices, etc.).\n\n\nTips related to collaboration with clients and users. There are different kinds of clients with varied levels of knowledge regarding the possibilities and limits of data science, and each kind requires an appropriate way of communicating these issues. It is also important to establish clarity about mutual expectations, about what is guaranteed and what is experimental, about how your work will be evaluated, and about how you will integrate with different stakeholders in the client's organization. This alignment with your client is a critical element of a successful service.\n\n\n \nRecent years have brought an explosion of algorithms, models and software libraries for doing data science that allow unprecedented possibilities for solving problems. But providing a data science service as a consultant or a company involves more than just tools. In this talk, I will share the most useful lessons that I learned while working at a company providing these services.

LIGO and other detectors will now be improved further to detect more signals from black holes and other elusive objects, kickstarting a new type of astronomy.\nAt the core of the LIGO observatories are very large laser interferometers. The concept for these interferometers is well known but has been enhanced with new technology. It typically takes several years of work after the interferometers have been first turned on, until they reach their full sensitivity. Numerical simulations play an important role in the process. In recent years we have developed new Python-based tools to model the optical systems. Such tools must remain accessible to the experimentalists in charge of the instruments, to be used effectively in large collaborations.\nI will give a short introduction to the LIGO project and present examples from our work to support the LIGO detectors with numerical modelling tools.

Typical problems involve real-time data from sensors collected by telecom operators to GPS data produced by vehicle tracking systems. One widespread framework to solve those inherently difficult problems is Apache Spark. In this talk, we want to share our best practices with PySpark, Spark\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Python API, highlighting our experience as well as dos and don'ts. In particular, we will focus on the whole data science pipeline from data ingestion, data munging and wrangling to the actual model building. \nFinally, many businesses have started to realise that there is no return on investment from data science if the models do not go into production. At Pivotal Labs, one our core principle is API first. Therefore, we will also talk how we put our models into production, sharing our hands-on knowledge in this field and also how this fits into test-driven development.\n \nIn this talk we will share our best practices of using PySpark in numerous customer facing data science engagements.

Results from twin studies suggest that genetic factors account for 80% of the variation of the disorder. However, to date, these have not been fully identified. Traditional methods involve performing a Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS), to find estimates of association that different mutations in DNA have with the disease.\nSchizophrenia is a highly polygenic disorder, meaning that it arises from a combination of genetic mutations, all contributing a small level of effect. These studies require very large sample sizes to have the statistical power to identify mutations of interest.\nThe common approach is to combine this information into a single polygenic risk score for an individual, which can then be assessed for its predictive power to identify cases of the disease using a single feature Logistic Regression model.\nThe machine learning approach\nInstead of creating this single score, different features from the individual association scores were created for use as inputs to machine learning algorithms. These features were either the information from the individual mutations themselves, or collections of mutations in genes which are known to be involved in various functional networks.\nThe algorithm chosen was the Support Vector Machine (SVM). This was for a number of reasons:\n\nThey can cope with a large number of input features, and can apply penalty procedures such as L1 regression to identify important features.\nKernel methods can be used to find evidence for interactions between the features - something that is lacking in the traditional methods.\n\nPython libraries used\nThis work was made possible by the use of two seminal libraries for Python: Pandas and scikit-learn. In addition the Joblib modules were used to carry out some simple parallel processing tasks on an HPC cluster if the desired information was not already provided by the modules in scikit-learn which already have these built in.\nPandas made collecting information from sub-sets of the data very quick and efficient to carry out. Examples of this functionality will be given in the talk.\nResults so far\nWhile not improving on predictive power, the models did provide a rich insight into the association that different gene-networks have with the disorder, and identified genes which are targets of the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP) supporting findings from recent research in molecular biology. The information showing this were the coefficients assigned to the features seen in the boxplot provided. This was created by building multiple models, each with different train/test splits of the data to get the distributions of the coefficients. As can be seen, those assigned to the FMRP feature are consistently higher.\nThe findings also show evidence for pair wise interactions between single point mutations. A series of procedures were carried out to simulate positive cases based on differing levels of contributions from main effects and interactions. This showed that without the contribution of the interactions, the results seen in the real world dataset by the kernel based models would not have been possible. Full details of how this was carried out will be discussed.\n \nThis study uses machine learning methods in scikit-learn to find insights into the genetic aetiology of schizophrenia. It expands on the method of using a single genetic risk score per sample, by creating features from sub-sets of the genome - from single DNA mutations to functional gene-networks. The results have identified potential risk networks and evidence for interactions between mutations.", "Iterables and Iterators: Going Loopy With Python\n \nThe talk's outline is given below.

We had one job, it ran at 1AM, and it was good. Then we added another job, and to make them run one after the other, we used Luigi, which says \"This can only run when this is finished\". Then we added another ~500 jobs, long running scikitlearn computes, external API dependencies, a business reporting systems with 2000+ reports and 400+ users and a scheduling system with 5000+ users. This is when things got interesting.\nThis is the story of building the data systems at Deliveroo.  This is not a talk about Big Data, cutting edge algorithms or new open source technology. Rather, this is a talk about coping with complexity in a rapidly changing landscape. I'll start from the beginning, giving a brief overview of what Luigi is and why we decided to roll with it. The body of the talk will be about the challenges we faced as our company grew in size and complexity, the solutions that worked (and those that didn't), and what we know now that we didn't know then. I'll cover a bit of the luigi syntax itself, but mostly I'll focus on the things we did around luigi that made it work for us; how (not) to design pipelines, how to test them, how to manage issues gracefully and how to detect problems in advance. \nBy attending this session you'll learn:\n\nWhy DAG based ETL systems are fundamentally useful\nWhat to think about when designing your DAG\nWhat to implement early to save you pain later on\n\n \nAt Deliveroo we've built our data plumbing from the ground up using Luigi to manage our data workflows.

It also supplies 20% of the calories consumed by humanity, and 35% of us depend on it for survival, so there is a strong motivation to understand it. The fact that wheat is not only not a 'model organism' but has some features which means assumptions generally made by the writers of bioinformatics software don't hold makes it hard to work with. In fact, often tools which document themselves as being suitable for use with data in the formats wheat researchers use fall over in this use case. Ideally, we would have time to rewrite them exactly for our use case, but this doesn't always happen. \nThis may either be a discussion or a talk. So far I've moved hardware twice, abandoned tools, rewritten parts of tools for my use case (I have a simple python example of this), my current task is to understand in detail why a particular piece of software is segfaulting so I will have a lot more insight very shortly.\nI will aim to keep the talk more about how to deal with data which differs significantly from the standards in a given field than the particulars of wheat, but there are some neat bioinformatics algorithms so I will explain one to demonstrate why we need to store so much in RAM. \n \nTBC, but along the lines of:  What do you do when your data, whilst formally meeting common requirements, is, to put it mildly, an edge case? And what if you don't have the time to write a bespoke tool for your analysis? I discuss this scenario, and will explain why my data is such difficult to start with.

To perform inference on these models, however, is often mathematically very challenging, and thus requires time-deriving equations as well as simplifying assumptions (like the normality assumption) to make inference mathematically tractable.\nProbabilistic programming is a new programming paradigm that provides the best of both worlds and revolutionizes the field of machine learning. Recent methodological advances in sampling algorithms like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), as well as huge increases in processing power, allow for almost complete automation of the inference process. Probabilistic programming thus greatly increases the number of people who can successfully build statistical models and machine learning algorithms, and makes experts radically more effective. Data scientists can create complex generative Bayesian models tailored to the structure of the data and specific problem at hand, but without the burden of mathematical tractability or limitations due to mathematical simplifications.\nThis talk will provide an overview of PyMC3, a new probabilistic programming package for Python featuring intuitive syntax and next-generation sampling algorithms.\n \nProbabilistic programming is a new paradigm that greatly increases the number of people who can successfully build statistical models and machine learning algorithms, and makes experts radically more effective.

Today, despite the large amount of progress in Computer Vision due to advances in Deep learning, cross-modal representation learning remains constrained by vector representation. Techniques based on vector representation have a number of limitations: first, they do not necessarily capture the intra-class variability; second, they do not express the uncertainty associated with assigning target concepts to input data, and finally, distance between the objects is commonly computed as the dot product between their corresponding vectors, a metric which does not allow asymmetric comparisons. \nIn our work, we attempt to go beyond vector representation and move towards representations based on probability distributions. In particular, we use Gaussian embedding which innately incorporates uncertainty and forms a basis upon which various divergences can be defined (e.g. f-divergence). In addition, we consider transferring representations learnt from images to text for better distributional semantic models. We draw inspiration from earlier work on kernels on distributions to propose an embedding space for words and images for efficient cross-modal representation learning and show how one can transfer from visual mode to language mode or vice-versa.\nFinally, we demonstrate examples in learning word representation, image annotation and retrieval, and zero-shot learning. \n \nIn this talk, we introduce an alternative to vector representation based on Gaussian distribution, and we show various learning algorithms using distributions for cross-modal representation learning. We show various advantages of learning based on distributions and demonstrate examples in learning word/concept representation, image annotation and retrieval and zero-shot learning.", "Estimating Residential Land Prices in the UK\n \nThe goal of this project is to produce aggregate and local residential land price indices for England and Wales, and their local authorities, starting from house sales data (data on actual land sales are very sparse and not readily available). We address a current gap in UK statistics: the Valuation Office Agency discontinued its land price indices in 2011. Data on land values are important: they provide builders with information on the profitability of their investments and offer the public sector an instrument to evaluate decisions on land releases.\nWe attach to each house transaction in the England and Wales Land Registry (LR) Price Paid Dataset an estimate of the building volume and the associated land area. These additional variables are gathered from two data sources: (1) Ordnance Survey MasterMap, which includes information on the footprint and height of all buildings in Great Britain, and (2) LR maps of freehold land parcels, which can be freely downloaded online for each local authority. After putting together our dataset with QGIS and R, we can decompose each sale price in LR Price Paid into a \u00e2\u0080\u009cstructure\u00e2\u0080\u009d and a \u00e2\u0080\u009cland\u00e2\u0080\u009d component using regression methods.

Using this as a basis, we trained a manifold that maps images to a space where duplicates have a small distance and different products have a large distance. \n \nWith an inventory of millions of products, finding duplicates is intractable by hand. Neural networks can be used to learn a representation that maps duplicates close together in a manifold. ", "Hierarchical Bayesian Modelling with PyMC3 and PySTAN\n \nOverview\nBayesian inference bridges the gap between white-box model introspection and black-box predictive performance. We gain the ability to fully specify a model and fit it to observed data according to our prior knowledge. Small datasets are handled well and the overall method and results are very intuitive: lending to both statistical insight and future prediction.\nThis talk will demonstrate the use of Bayesian inference in a real-world scenario: using a set of hierarchical models to compare exhaust emissions data from a set of vehicle manufacturers.\nThis will be interesting to people who work in the Type A side of data science, and will demonstrate usage of the tools as well as some theory.\nThe Frameworks\nPyMC3 and PySTAN are two of the leading frameworks for Bayesian inference in Python: offering concise model specification, MCMC sampling, and a growing amount of built-in conveniences for model validation, verification and prediction. \nPyMC3 is an iteration upon the prior PyMC2, and comprises a comprehensive package of symbolic statistical modelling syntax and very efficient gradient-based samplers using the Theano library (of deep-learning fame) for gradient computation. Of particular interest is that it includes the Non U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) developed recently by Hoffman & Gelman in 2014, which is only otherwise available in STAN.\nPySTAN is a wrapper around STAN, a major3 open-source framework for Bayesian inference developed by Gelman, Carpenter, Hoffman and many others. STAN also has HMC and NUTS samplers, and recently, Variational Inference - which is a very efficient way to approximate the joint probability distribution. Models are specified in a custom syntax and compiled to C++.\nThe Real-World Problem & Dataset\nI'm currently quite interested in road traffic and vehicle insurance, so I've dug into the UK VCA (Vehicle Type Approval) to find their Car Fuel and Emissions Information for August 2015. The raw dataset is available for direct download and is small but varied enough for our use here: roughly 2500 cars and 10 features inc hierarchies of car parent-manufacturer > manufacturer > model.\nI will investigate the car emissions data from the point-of-view of the Volkswagen Emissions Scandal which seems to have meaningfully damaged their sales. Perhaps we can find unusual results in the emissions data for Volkswagen.\n \nCan we use Bayesian inference to determine unusual car emissions test for Volkswagen? In this worked example, I'll demonstrate hierarchical linear regression using both PyMC3 and PySTAN, and compare the flexibility and modelling strengths of each framework.", "Twinkle twinkle little star, how I wonder what you are...\n \nIn my pervious life, I was an astronomer and one of the big tasks many PhD students face is manual star classification.

Finance professionals face multiple challenges as the volume of data they are analysing increases and at the same time the data sources get more diverse. In order to address the information overload problem both established financial news providers and social media services present condensed information: in the form of news headlines (e.g. Bloomberg and Reuters) or by imposing limits on the text length (a Twitter message is formed of maximum 140 characters). On the other hand, in recent years, an increasing number of content filtering and alerting systems have been developed. \n Knowsis is a fintech startup focusing on social media analytics. One of the systems that we developed - Anomaly Detection and Alerting - is aimed at informing the user whenever it identifies an unexpected and novel tweet. Anomaly detection is driven by social volume, i.e. not all tweets which deviate from what is expected are anomalies, but a critical number of tweets is required. In addition, we do not want to alert the user about old information. \n The talk will present the approach that we took in building the system, highlighting issues that we encountered along the way and how we tackled them. In the second part of the talk we are going to show how one can build a similar anomaly detection system from scratch and use it to detect a particular anomalous scenario. We are going to use Poisson models to identify anomalies and Locality-Sensitive Hashing for novelty detection. The code will be written in Python using the scikit-learn and statsmodels libraries and made available to the audience. \n \nIn recent years Twitter has gained importance as a datasource for finance professionals alongside news. However, several challenges appear when identifying relevant information and finding the latest unexpected developments. In this talk we are going to present our experience developing an anomaly detection and alerting system and analyse a particular anomalous scenario. ", "Python flying at 40,000 feet\n \nIntroduction\nIn this talk we present data exploration and machine learning algorithms applied to aircraft  black-box data. We believe that safety algorithms have to be open source so everybody could apply them to increase flight safety: it is all about using Python to fly safer.\nData\nWe shall firstly briefly explain how the black boxes data is downloaded from an aircraft upon landing. Shortly after that, a Python tool to analyse the flight data is launched (you can find it in the open source repo FlightDataAnalyzer of Flight Data Services). To be able to analyse the data properly and to give context to it, a flight has to be segmented into taxi-out, take-off roll, take-off, climb, cruise, holding, descent, landing, touchdown, decelerating and taxi-in phases. A set of sophisticated deterministic and probabilistic algorithms is applied to the data to detect key-points of a flight, like take-off and touchdown points, and values of flight parameters at those points. The detection of these points and the calculation of the associated values of parameters (like acceleration at touchdown) are difficult problems which we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll share and try to solve with the help of the audience.\nWe plan to present a simplified version (due to short time available for presentations) of detecting the end-point of take-off phase as an important datum for further flight analysis.\nWe want to stress about the importance of having a large number and good-quality data. Even with a not so sophisticated algorithm, one can get great results if he/she has a good dataset at hand. We have 4,000,000 flights in the database that grows daily and that enables us to give better predictions. We want to go farther by promoting flight data-sharing concepts between different airlines so we get better statistics on relevant parameters - everything for the sake of flight safety!\nAlgorithms and tools\nThe detection of the switching-phase points is very challenging since the parameters vary very much amongst aircraft types. It is even a challenge for an experienced pilot when he looks at the data! However, we can learn from the data across multiple flights first and this is where Bayesian logic gets in the play. Assuming the independence between the parameters (for the sake of simplicity), we obtain simple formulas to calculate the posterior probability for the end-of-take-off point. This assumption, though very strong, gives great initial results. Furthermore, sometimes a sensor on one engine stops working (not the engine itself! :). In this case we can just omit this signal and use what we are left with. Again, the results are more than acceptable.\nWe will show how we use R for data exploration and Jupyter-notebooks (Python) for prototyping and how these two are complimentary. The fine-tuned algorithms are integrated in the system by using Python, exclusively. We make heavy use of third party open source libraries such as numpy, scipy, pandas, pymc, etc..\n \nHave you ever seen real black-boxes' data? For safety, airlines worldwide are obliged to monitor their flights' data - the same that is stored in aircraft black boxes.  Look how we do it with Python and open source technologies at hand. It's never easy with these multivariate time-series - they can be incomplete and contain varying number of flight parameters - we'll deal with it!", "Irregular time series and how to whip them\n \nIrregular time series and how to whip them\nHistory of irregular time series\nStatisticians have long grappled with what to do in the case of missing data, and missing data in a time series is a special, but very common, case of the general problem of missing data. Luckily, irregular time series offer more information and more promising techniques than simple guesswork and rules of thumb.\nYour best options\nI'll discuss best-practices for irregular time series, emphasizing in particular early-stage decision making driven by data and the purpose of a particular analysis. I'll also highlight best-Python practices and state of the art frameworks that correspond to statistical best practices.\nIn particular I'll cover the following topics:\n\nVisualizing irregular time series\nDrawing inferences from patterns of missing data\nCorrelation techniques for irregular time series\nCausal analysis for irregular time series\n\n \nThis talk will present best-practices and most commonly used methods for dealing with irregular time series. Though we'd all like data to come at regular and reliable intervals, the reality is that most time series data doesn't come this way. Fortunately, there is a long-standing theoretical framework for knowing what does and doesn't make sense for corralling this irregular data.", "What's new in High Performance Python?\n \nScaling up the performance of Python applications without having to resort to writing the performance-critical sections in native code can be challenging. This process of performance optimisation has three parts: determining which parts of an application are performance\ncritical; understanding their performance; and acting on that understanding to implement optimisations. This talk is about the latest developments and tools for all these aspects of High Performance Python.\nThe Python profiler and Kernprof provide some explanation of the performance of Python programs; this talk will demonstrate the Accelerate Profiler, which is Numpy-aware and builds on the standard profiling tools by capturing the flow of arrays throughout program\nexecution. Interactive experimentation and exploration of captured profile information is done in an IPython notebook, simplifying the performance optimisation workflow.\nThe second part of this talk is about Numba, a tool that compiles user-selected Python functions to native code at runtime, for performance boosts of up to 100x for particular samples of code. Numba is in continuous development, with many additions made over the past\nyear, making it applicable for optimising an ever-increasing selection of performance-critical code. We will introduce and demonstrate  applications of recent additions including JIT classes, parallel Multicore/CUDA ufuncs and gufuncs, the @generate_jit decorator (similar to generated functions in Julia) and support for CFFI. The combination of Numba and CFFI is particularly powerful, enabling seamless integration of optimised native code into High Performance Python code.\n \nA tour of recent tool developments for understanding and optimising the performance of Python code, covering profiling tools, Numba, and CFFI. The talk will include demonstrations of these tools and their features using motivating examples.", "Word Embeddings for fun and profit in Gensim\n \nA tour of  word embeddings, their Python implementations and their use in the industry. \nWe will start with theory and academic results for word2vec, glove, swivel and Word Movers Distance.\nThen proceed to their Python open source implementations mainly in the Gensim package\n \nPython has great open source libraries to extract data from its most raw format - the human readable text. We will discuss a family of algorithms called word embeddings - Word2Vec being most famous and how they can be used in practice using Gensim package", "Modelling a text corpus using Deep Boltzmann Machines in python\n \nDeep Boltzmann machines (DBMs) are exciting for a variety of reasons, principal among which is the fact that they are able to learn probabilistic representations of data in an entirely unsupervised manner. This allows DBMs to leverage large quantities of unlabelled data which are often available. The resulting representations can then be fine-tuned using limited labelled data or studied to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of the data at hand. \nThis talk will begin by providing a high level description of DBMs and the training algorithms involved in learning such models. A topic modelling example will be used as a motivating example to discuss practical aspects of fitting DBMs and potential pitfalls. The entire code for this project is written in python using only standard libraries (e.g., numpy). \n \nDeep Boltzmann machines (DBMs) are exciting for a variety of reasons, principal among which is the fact that they are able to learn probabilistic representations of data in an entirely unsupervised manner.

", "Robot detection in IT environments\n \nThe robot detection module that I will present is a part of the machine learning-driven, real-time user behavior analytic (UBA) tool of Balabit, called Blindspotter. Its main purpose is to detect internal and external attackers in an IT environment. Blindspotter gathers contextual information about the activities of users, and notifies the security analyst when an unusual event is found. We use the Python language both for the proof of concept experimentation of data scientists and for production as well.\nHumans and robots have different behavior patterns, for instance robots can be active for very long time periods, or they can have extremely high or very low diversity in some features. This implicates that in many aspects humans and robots need different monitoring techniques. Therefore, we should be able to identify the usage type of the account and handle humans and scripts separately in the UBA tool.\nFurthermore, it is also critical to know for security reasons when a human user's account becomes a scripted account or when a scheduled robot suddenly starts to behave like it was used by a human.\nFor example, an impostor coming from outside might attack a more easily crackable scripted account and start some manual activities there to look around in the system. Or a malicious insider could start running scripts to collect sensitive data. With the robot detection algorithm we can notice the sudden change in the usage patterns of the accounts.\nIn the presentation I will introduce the methodologies that we developed to detect scripted accounts (robots) in IT systems, based on their activities. Different aspects of robotic behavior has been investigated, for example rare scheduled activities surrounded by normal behavior or periodic patterns with some noise in it. I will illustrate the cases with examples found in real data.\n \nIn this talk, I will present the robot detection module of a machine learning-driven user behavior analytic tool. New methodologies were developed to distinguish between scripted accounts and human users, based on their activities. I will demonstrate a couple of statistical methods, like hypothesis tests from the SciPy library that we use to capture different aspects of robotic operation.", "Spherical Voronoi Diagrams in Python\n \nImagine you are in London and want to travel somewhere within London. Your smartphone ran out of battery and you are not familiar with the area. So you just go the closest tube station. In this manner, you could get a map of London partitioned into regions of closest distance to the various tube stations. Mathematically, this is called a Voronoi diagram. It is defined by a finite set of points in the plane, which are called generators (the tube stations in this example), and consists of a finite number of polygons representing the regions of closest distance to the generators (see Wikipedia  for pictures and more details). Calculating Voronoi diagrams in the plane is a well known problem in computational geometry and can be easily handled in Python using scipy.spatial.Voronoi.\nImagine you are in London and want to travel to some destination far away. Since you are close to an airport, you want to go by plane. In a similar fashion, the airports partition the surface of the Earth into regions of closest distance. Mathematically, this is called a spherical Voronoi diagram. Analogously, this is defined by a finite set of generator points on a sphere and consists of finitely many spherical polygons representing the regions of closest spherical distance to the generator points. (Play with this online sandbox if you like.)\nAt PyData London 2015, Tyler Reddy discussed the problem of calculating spherical Voronoi diagrams in Python in this talk. While the problem had been studied and solved conceptually by various computer scientists, there was no ready-to-go implementation available in Python. This initiated a collaboration, which ultimately led to the creation of scipy.spatial.SphericalVoronoi. \nThis talk will give a self-contained introduction to the topic of Voronoi diagrams and tell the story of the pull request mentioned above. We will also highlight some applications of spherical Voronoi diagrams in computational virology aimed at getting a better insight into the Dengue virus and Hepatitis C, which was Tylers original motivation to consider the problem. \n \nSpherical Voronoi diagrams partition the surface of a sphere into regions of closest distance to a set of generator points. As discussed by Tyler Reddy at PyData 2015, there was no ready-to-go implementation of this in Python. After a self-contained introduction, we will tell the story about how this talk led to an extension of scipy to handle this problem.", "Assurance Scoring: Using Machine Learning and Analytics to Reduce Risk in the Public Sector\n \nTraditionally, risk scoring frameworks are built around the customer journey to identify non-compliant or fraudulent behaviour. These frameworks combine data from different sources and historical known fraud to identify high risk transactions or applications. In the public sector, however, the emphasis is often on identifying low-risk customers. In this talk we will discuss an Assurance Scoring framework which applies these traditional machine learning and analytics techniques but changes this emphasis and identifies those customers posing minimum risk. The advantage of this approach is that low risk transactions can be automated (which account for the majority of customers) and resources can be focused more effectively to handle those exceptional high risk cases. \nThis framework has been developed in Python, in particular with Pandas and Scikit-Learn. But we also go beyond Machine Learning to incorporate other techniques such as rules based linking, anomaly detection and graph based analysis, and show how these can be used to boost the confidence of the low-risk group.\nIn particular, we will showcase how different python packages have been integrated to address the data pre-processing, feature engineering, model building & validation problems and how we have solved the challenges faced during the integration process by developing a range of testing procedures. \n \nWe will talk about a framework we have developed to use Machine Learning and other advanced analytical methods to reduce risk in the Public Sector. This python-based assurance scoring framework, developed with Pandas & Scikit-Learn, changes the emphasis of traditional risk-scoring frameworks to identifying compliant behaviour; we discuss some of the challenges faced and present a case study. ", "Customising nbconvert: how to turn Jupyter notebooks into anything you want\n \nJupyter Notebooks are code-centric documents including prose, maths, code, and rich output, such as images and HTML. These are all stored in a structured JSON file, with metadata about each input and output. nbconvert is a highly extensible tool for converting those JSON notebooks to other formats, such as HTML, LaTeX, PDF, and restructuredText. nbconvert powers the web service nbviewer, which renders any notebooks on the Web as HTML, so that they can be read by anyone with a browser and internet connection.

In many scenarios this can be counteracted by asking multiple workers to complete the same task, but that dramatically increases cost and can still be error-prone. Detecting lazy work is another way to increase quality of gathered data and we have found a way to do this reliably for quite a large variety of tasks.\nIn this talk I will describe how we have trained a machine learning model to discriminate between good and sloppy work. The outline is as follows:\n- describe the specific problem we had (5m)\n- overview of the solution (2m)\n- ML model details (10m)\n  - data capture\n  - labelling\n  - balancing the dataset\n  - feature engineering\n  - training, retraining\n  - model itself\n- model persistence (10m)\n- productizing the result by putting it behind an HTTP API (3m)\n- limitations, trade-offs, what could we do better (3m)\n \nIf you have ever used crowdsourcing, you know that dealing with sloppy workers is a major part of the effort. Come see this talk if you want to learn about how to solve this problem using machine learning and some elbow grease. As a bonus, you will also find out how to properly persist your ML models and use them to serve predictions through an HTTP API."], "meta": ["Dave DeBarr (seattle, Intermediate)", "Joe McCarthy (seattle, Intermediate)", "Valentina Staneva (seattle, Novice)", "James Powell (seattle, Novice)", "Quentin Caudron (seattle, Novice)", "Jim Crist (seattle, Novice)", "Maxwell W Libbrecht (seattle, Intermediate)", "Steve Dower (seattle, Novice)", "Stephen Elston (seattle, Novice)", "Denny Lee (seattle, Novice)", "Lingqiang Kong (seattle, Novice)", "Alex Thomas (seattle, Intermediate)", "Katrina Riehl (seattle, Novice)", "Felix Cheung (seattle, Intermediate)", "Jason Kessler (seattle, Intermediate)", "Andreas Schreiber (seattle, Novice)", "George Richardson (seattle, Novice)", "Olivia Gunton (seattle, Intermediate)", "Claire Kelley (seattle, Intermediate)", "Ryan J.
